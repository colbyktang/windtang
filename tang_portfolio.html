                    <h3>Portfolio Introduction</h3>
                    <p>This portfolio showcases the work I've done in my Interactive Media course at St. Edward's University. Programs used include Audacity, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and Animate. Additionally, this web page is being hosted on my local web server using Apache on my Raspberry Pi.</p>

                    <p>Using various images I arranged a scene where each image is on its own Photoshop layer as practice. I added a few adjustment layers and some glow to the subjects caught in the UFO beam.</p>

                    <a href="https://kiwi-the-killer.glitch.me/">Kiwi the Killer Site</a>
                    <p>I used a Glitch site to practice HTML by making a website for my cat Kiwi. I kept the page simple to make it easy to read and look at. This practice helped me with this portfolio that you're looking at!</p>

                    <h2><i>Illustrator Logo - Katt Kafé</i></h2>
                    <img src="images/bdmm/Katt_Kafe.png" class="image">
                    <p>Using Adobe Illustrator, I created a banner for a mock company. I wanted to convey a friendly environment with cats through my design and I did this through a
                    number of ways. </p>
                    
                    <p>I used a pale blue background to give the banner an overall softer look and a
                    welcoming palette. I drew a cat head with a boba tea drink on top as a silly logo but as it also
                    conveys a chill environment since the cat head seems content with having a drink on its head. I
                    kept the text Katt Kafé simple to read to give a sense of simplicity and cleanliness. There’s
                    nothing else to the place: you eat, drink, and hang out with cats. I kept the red and green color
                    scheme to the text/logo since they are complementary colors and go well aesthetically.
                    Choosing boba tea as the drink to showcase the food aspect of the business attracts people
                    that are following the current boba tea trend. Additionally, boba tea has a distinct look that
                    people can recognize.</p>
