Node which contained the edge which was hit. If the linecast did not hit anything then this will be set to the last node along the line\textquotesingle{}s path (the one which contains the endpoint). 

For layered grid graphs the linecast will return true (i.\+e\+: no free line of sight) if when walking the graph we ended up at X,Z coordinate for the end node even if end node was on a different level (e.\+g the floor below or above in a building). In this case no node edge was really hit so this field will still be null.\mbox{\Hypertarget{struct_pathfinding_1_1_graph_hit_info_aaf592dfdf6d35390a580a76e441bdfb4}\label{struct_pathfinding_1_1_graph_hit_info_aaf592dfdf6d35390a580a76e441bdfb4}}
