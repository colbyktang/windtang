\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+2.\+10 (2019-\/11-\/19)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This release contains fixes and features that have been backported from the 4.\+3 beta.
\item Upgrade notes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This release is supported in Unity 2017.\+3 L\+TS and later. Support for earlier versions has been dropped (however it probably still works in all 2017.\+x releases).
\item The Unity Web\+Player target is no longer supported. This target was deprecated in Unity 5.\+4.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a crash when scanning a graph on the Web\+GL platform and exception support is disabled.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+2.\+9 (2019-\/11-\/15)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This release contains fixes and features that have been backported from the 4.\+3 beta.
\item Upgrade notes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This release is supported in Unity 2017.\+3 L\+TS and later. Support for earlier versions has been dropped (however it probably still works in all 2017.\+x releases).
\item The Unity Web\+Player target is no longer supported. This target was deprecated in Unity 5.\+4.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a visualization for which dimension of the hexagons that is being edited when using a hexagonal grid graph. \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}
\item Rich\+AI\textquotesingle{}s Funnel Simplification now does a straight line check as the first thing it does. This can help improve both performance and the quality of the path.
\item Added a small helper window to the scene view when the A$\ast$ Inspector is open. I think this should work well with the dark Unity theme as well, but please start a thread in the support forum if something looks off. \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}
\item Using managed code stripping even up to the High level is now supported out of the box.
\item If an R\+V\+O\+Controller was attached to a Game\+Object with an A\+I\+Path/\+Rich\+AI component during runtime after the movement script had been initialized then the movement script would previously possibly not find it. This is fixed now and the R\+V\+O\+Controller notifies the A\+I\+Path/\+Rich\+AI script that it has been attached.
\item The \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_a86eb322f611af919dad08b78e580edf4}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+Set\+Path}} method on all built-\/in movement scripts can now be passed a null parameter. This will clear the current path of the agent. In earlier versions this caused an exception to be thrown.
\item Fixed Navmesh\+Base.\+Linecast (used by Recast\+Graph and Navmesh linecast methods) would not fill the trace out parameter with the starting node in case the start point of the linecast was identical to the end point.
\item A\+I\+Path and Rich\+AI now clear their paths when they are disabled. Not clearing the path has caused some issues when using object pooling and also some other unexpected behavior. If you want to just temporarily disable the movement then use the \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_aafc061b743ad47c8079cc46a0d854866}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+can\+Move}} or \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_adaf2a74d7f7e08c86987b969431304fb}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+is\+Stopped}} properties.
\item Fixed Rich\+A\+I.\+remaining\+Distance could refer to the previous path for one frame after a new path had been calculated.
\item Fixed A\+I\+Path and Rich\+AI scripts sometimes starting with a height of 0.\+01 when creating a new component in the unity inspector. Now they start with a more reasonable height of 2.\+0.
\item The A\+I\+Base.\+using\+Gravity setter is now protected instead of private which helps when overriding some methods.
\item The \char`\"{}\+Show Surface\char`\"{} mode on recast and navmesh graphs is now enabled by default when creating a new graph.
\item The system no longer destroys itself in On\+Application\+Quit and is instead always destroyed during On\+Destroy. Using On\+Application\+Quit could cause trouble when the quitting process was cancelled (e.\+g. using Application.\+wants\+To\+Quit).
\item Fixed exceptions could be thrown in the editor if the project contains some assemblies that can for some reason not be read. Thanks joshcamas for reporting this.
\item Changed the automatic graph coloring limits code to ignore nodes that are unwalkable. This improves the contrast when some unwalkable nodes, that are not visible anyway, have very high penalties (or whatever other value you are visualizing in the scene view).
\item Fixed missing null checks in Triangle\+Mesh\+Node.\+Get\+Portal and Triangle\+Mesh\+Node.\+Shared\+Edge.
\item The Rich\+AI inspector will now show a helpful warning if one tries to use it in a scene that does not contain a navmesh or recast graph.
\item Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Utilities.\+Get\+Contours for grid graphs now simplifies the contour more consistently. Previously there could be one or two additional points where the algorithm started to traverse the contour.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+2.\+8 (2019-\/04-\/29)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Made it possible for nearest node queries on point graphs to find the closest connection instead of just the closest node. This will make it easier to use graphs when you have many long connections. See \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_point_graph_ad0862813b3ecd1396ab6aa65f49f3910}{Pathfinding.\+Point\+Graph.\+nearest\+Node\+Distance\+Mode}}.
\item Improved the Seeker-\/$>$Start\+End\+Modifier\textquotesingle{}s Connection snapping mode. Now it will behave better if the path only moves along a single connection in the graph.
\item Fixed a crash when deploying for Nintendo Switch due to a Unity bug when setting thread names. Thanks Toasty\+Stoemp for reporting this.
\item Fixed some compiler warnings in the Obj\+Importer class that would show up on some platforms.
\item Fixed Grid\+Graph.\+Calculate\+Connections\+For\+Cell\+And\+Neighbours would throw an exception when called with the coordinates for a node on the border of the grid. Thanks davidpare for reporting this.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+2.\+7 (2019-\/04-\/05)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Significantly improved graph rendering performance for recast graphs when using a very large number of small tiles.
\item Fixed Grid\+Graph.\+Count\+Nodes throwing an exception when the graph is not scanned. Now it will return 0.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+2.\+6 (2019-\/03-\/23)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed A\+I\+Path.\+reached\+Destination and Rich\+A\+I.\+reached\+Destination only worked when the y coordinate of the agent was close to zero... which it of course was in all my tests. Sorry about this silly bug and the headache it may have caused.
\item Fixed loading a serialized navmesh graph when the source mesh no longer existed would cause the graph to be offset if a navmesh cut was later used to cut it.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+2.\+5 (2019-\/02-\/14)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a new documentation page for how to create and configure graphs during runtime. runtime-\/graphs (view in online documentation for working links).
\item Added a new documentation page about editing point graph connections manually. editing-\/graphs (view in online documentation for working links).
\item Fixed exceptions could be thrown if the project contains some assemblies that can for some reason not be read.
\item Fixed the visualization for unwalkable nodes (red cubes) sometimes disappearing in newer versions of Unity (2018.\+2+ I think) due to a change in how Time.\+rendered\+Frame\+Count works. Thanks Kevin Jenkins for reporting this.
\item Fixed applying optimizations (under the Optimizations tab) could cause several error messages to be logged about unsupported platforms in Unity 2018.\+3 or newer. Thanks Nox\+Mortem for reporting the issue.
\item Fixed A\+I\+Path throwing an exception if it was given a valid path that contained no nodes at all.
\item Made Path.\+Get\+Tag\+Penalty public instead of internal.
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_b_path_ae0abcb1ed0acab5635ced85fee38266a}{Pathfinding.\+A\+B\+Path.\+Fake\+Path}}.
\item Worked around a null reference exception bug when using I\+L2\+C\+PP and deploying for i\+Phone. This is caused by a bug in the I\+L2\+C\+PP compiler.
\item Fixed custom graph types could not be used if they were in another assembly. Thanks juskelis for reporting this and founderio for finding a fix.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+2.\+4 (2018-\/12-\/03)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added an option for which dimension of the hexagon to adjust in the grid graph editor when using the hexagonal mode. This significantly helps with making a hexagonal graph line up with your other game elements as previously you might have had to manually calculate some complicated conversion factors in order to do this.
\item Fixed loading navmesh graphs from a file could be extremely slow if the graph had been saved with the source mesh field set to a mesh with an empty name and your project had a lot of things in its Resources folder.
\item Fixed a massive performance regression when using R\+VO together with I\+L2\+C\+PP and .net 4.\+6 due to changes in how the .net framework handles locking internally.
\item Made Graph\+Node.\+Destroy public again (it was made internal in 4.\+2) because without that, it is not possible to make custom graph types.
\item Made Path.\+Pipeline\+State, Path.\+duration and Path.\+path\+ID public again (they were made internal in 4.\+2) because those properties are actually useful even for non-\/internal use. This also fixes some incompatibility issues with the Node Canvas integration package. Thanks jsaracev and Grofit for reporting this.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+2.\+3 (2018-\/11-\/07)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed some compiler warnings in the free version on newer versions of Unity.
\item Fixed a bug which caused point graphs to interpret the nearest node distance limit as being 1/1000th the actual value in the free version of the package and in the pro version when not using the \textquotesingle{}optimize for sparse graph\textquotesingle{} option. This bug caused the point graph example scene to not work in the free version of the package.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+2.\+2 (2018-\/10-\/25)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed upgrading from an earlier 4.\+x version to 4.\+2 could cause compiler errors in some newer versions of Unity because the Unity\+Package doesn\textquotesingle{}t import the new directory structure correctly.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+2.\+1 (2018-\/10-\/23)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a bug which caused scanning navmesh graphs to throw an exception when using the free version of the package. Thanks Hunted for reporting the bug.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+2 (2018-\/10-\/17)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+1.\+17 through 4.\+1.\+26 were beta versions, all their changelogs have been merged into this one.
\item Upgrade notes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This release contains some breaking changes (primarily the pivot point change for characters that you can read about below). This will affect very few users, but I still recommend that you take a backup of your project before upgrading.
\item Since 4.\+1.\+23 the base of the character when using A\+I\+Path/\+Rich\+AI is always at the pivot point of the Transform. This reduces code complexity and improves performance. Most users would already have had configured their characters that way, but in rare cases you may have to adjust your characters a bit (mostly just move them up or down a bit).
\item When changing some low level fields that can affect the connectivity of the graph such as \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_mesh_node_ae2ff2da1b57b05418933fec03ceb68a0}{Pathfinding.\+Mesh\+Node.\+connections}} you must now call \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_graph_node_a0b21806526399565ea57fc4e8e4949b9}{Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Node.\+Set\+Connectivity\+Dirty()}}. The documentation for all the relevant fields mention this. Currently it only applies to the connection fields on the Mesh\+Node, Point\+Node and Grid\+Node\+Base classes. All high level methods that modify the connectivity do this automatically. Most likely you do not have to change your code.
\item When updating the graph using a work item, it is no longer necessary to call the Queue\+Flood\+Fill or Flood\+Fill methods. Due to the hierarchical graph update mentioned below, this is all handled transparently behind the scenes. You should remove any calls to those deprecated methods as they will (for backwards compatibility reasons) force a full recalculation of the connected components which is much slower than what is likely necessary.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Improvements
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Converted all comments to X\+ML comments. This will drastically improve intellisense for most users as Doxygen style comments are not supported by that many editors. As the whole codebase has been converted using a script, there is a potential for errors in the translation. Please let me know if you find anything which looks odd or where the intellisense info could be improved.
\item Improved recast graph scanning speed by up to 60\% in the unity editor on Mono2x. Surisingly this optimization doesn\textquotesingle{}t seem to matter much for other compiler backends. This may cause minor changes to your navmesh. If this change causes bad navmeshes to be generated or if it reduces performance, please start a thread in the forum.
\item The R\+V\+O\+Controller and A\+I\+Path/\+Rich\+AI scripts now take the scale of the object into account when using their respective height and radius fields. If you have an existing character with a non-\/unit scale the height and radius fields will automatically be updated to compensate for this scale. However if you are scaling characters during runtime, this may change their behaviour.
\item Added a new \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_pathfinding_1_1_graph_mask}{Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Mask}} struct to represent a set of graphs. Previously graph masks have been represented using pure integers (e.\+g. in \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_seeker_a8b7ceda751d8863d047f052a80a4bc26}{Pathfinding.\+Seeker.\+graph\+Mask}} and Pathfinding.\+N\+N\+Constraint.\+graph\+Mask). The new struct contains some nice helper methods like \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_pathfinding_1_1_graph_mask_aa3cbffd72929638b6338ad703980dfff}{Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Mask.\+From\+Graph\+Name}} which has been requested by many users.
\item Added a new documentation page describing the inspector\+: inspector (view in online documentation for working links).
\item Added a new documentation page with an overview of the different included movement scripts\+: movementscripts (view in online documentation for working links).
\item Added a new property on all movement scripts called \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_a9c671f788baec66af6b51c7462a53a60}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+reached\+Destination}}. The existing \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_a0b4009cade4a25ddc760cacb6669805e}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+reached\+End\+Of\+Path}} property has some quirks, which are very reasonable when considering how everything works, but are not very intuitive for new users and it can easily lead to quite brittle code. This new property will work as expected for most use cases.
\item Added a height and radius for the A\+I\+Path and Rich\+AI movement scripts. This in turn deprecates the old \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_a8316799eae5218bc12b14920c8f2bd1a}{Pathfinding.\+A\+I\+Base.\+center\+Offset}} field as it is now implicitly height/2. If an R\+V\+O\+Controller is attached to the same Game\+Object, its height and radius will be driven by the movement script\textquotesingle{}s values. The script will try to autodetect reasonable height and radius values from other attached components upon upgrading.
\item Improved look of all movement script inspectors by grouping the fields into different sections. Also added some validation to prevent invalid field values.
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_astar_data_a21b0e75ff4aa8af66025f06684f4e6df}{Pathfinding.\+Astar\+Data.\+Get\+Nodes}}.
\item Optimized graph rendering a bit. In particular if multiple scene views/in game cameras are used.
\item The default graph rendering mode is now \textquotesingle{}Solid Color\textquotesingle{} instead of \textquotesingle{}Areas\textquotesingle{}. This new mode will render the graphs with a single color as the name implies. The Area coloring mode has turned out to sometimes be confusing for new users and it is not useful that often anyway.
\item Improved performance of small graph updates on large graphs by a very large amount. Previously when making a small update to a large graph, updating the connected components of the graph using a flood fill has been the thing which took the longest time by far. Using a new internal hierarchical graph it is now possible to update large graphs much faster. For example making a small update to a 1024$\ast$1024 grid graph is on the order of 30 times faster and is now perfectly reasonable to do in real time (slightly depending on how the graph looks and its settings). The cost of the flood fill was previously offloaded to a separate thread, so it would not always be noticed in the Unity profiler, but it was there and \href{http://forum.arongranberg.com/t/updategraphs-lag-spikes}{\texttt{ could affect the performance of the game in strange ways}}. The performance of scanning a graph or updating the whole graph remains roughly the same. For more information about how this works, see \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_hierarchical_graph}{Pathfinding.\+Hierarchical\+Graph}}.
\item Removed small allocation that was previously done for each calculated path on grid graphs.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} threads now show up in the Unity Profiler in the Timeline view when using a recent Unity version (2017.\+3 or higher).
\item Scanning layered grid graphs is now approximately 2.\+2x as fast.
\item Updating layered grid graphs is now approximately 1.\+5x as fast.
\item Scanning and updating layered grid graphs now allocates a lot less memory.
\item Added assembly definition (.asmdef) files to the package and restructured things a bit. This will help cut down on the compilation times in your project. See \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html}{\texttt{ https\+://docs.\+unity3d.\+com/\+Manual/\+Script\+Compilation\+Assembly\+Definition\+Files.\+html}} for more info.
\item Improved performance of scanning and updating recast graphs, in particular with very large tiles.
\item Improved performance of get nearest queries on point graphs when not using Pathfinding.\+Point\+Graph.\+optimize\+For\+Sparse\+Graph.
\item Reduced memory usage of local avoidance slightly.
\item All navmesh/recast graphs now support navmesh cutting out of the box and the Tile\+Handler\+Helper component is no longer necessary. If you have a Tile\+Handler\+Helper component in your scene you can safely delete it after upgrading.
\item A\+I\+Path/\+Rich\+AI now has an option for disabling rotation completely. This was possible before as well, but the options you had to set were not entirely intuitive. The inspector has been restructured a bit to improve the ease of use.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed non-\/generic version of Path\+Pool which has been deprecated since early 2016.
\item Removed various methods in the Astar\+Math and Polygon classes which have been deprecated since early 2016.
\item Removed a few other things that have been deprecated since early 2016.
\item Removed Astar\+Path.\+Scan\+Loop which has been deprecated since 2015.
\item Removed Int\+Rect.\+Rotate and Int\+Rect.\+Offset because they were not used by any part of the package.
\item Removed the mostly internal method Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Collision.\+Raycast because it was not used by any code in the package.
\item Changed signature and behavior slightly of the mostly internal method \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_graph_collision_a3feefd373bc2c1f5b3777e64de847ad1}{Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Collision.\+Check\+Height\+All}}.
\item Replaced Pathfinding.\+Layer\+Grid\+Graph.\+Sample\+Cell with the new method Pathfinding.\+Layer\+Grid\+Graph.\+Sample\+Heights which does essentially the same thing, but in a more efficient way.
\item The rotation\+In2D option for the built-\/in movement scripts has been renamed to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_a245eab909f55d83dcbd3ca6262d778af}{Pathfinding.\+A\+I\+Base.\+orientation}} and is now an enum.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Replaced usage of the W\+WW class with the newer Unity\+Web\+Request in the update checker to avoid a deprecation compiler warning in newer versions of Unity.
\item Fixed a bug in the A$\ast$ inspector that could cause the inspector to log errors and look weird in Unity 2018.\+3b5 and up. Thanks Aisit for reporting the bug.
\item Fixed a rare race condition that could cause exceptions in various parts of the code due to the Stack\+Pool class not being thread safe. Thanks nindim for reporting the issue.
\item Fixed applying optimizations (under the Optimizations tab) could cause several error messages to be logged about unsupported platforms in Unity 2018.\+2 or newer and in 2017.\+4.
\item Fixed trying to set a tag on a node to a value outside the valid range (0...32) could silently cause very weird behavior as other fields were affected by that.
\item Fixed minor allocation when calling \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a7d49736e7a25f4cf9fc24bdbec862359}{Astar\+Path.\+Get\+Nearest}} without an N\+N\+Constraint.
\item Fixed a bug introduced in 4.\+1.\+22 which could cause a null reference exception to sometimes be thrown when visualizing graphs in the scene view.
\item Fixed \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_path_aedc88f47f6da4068be44b37bd3e93769}{Pathfinding.\+Path.\+Is\+Done}} could due to a race condition return true a tiny amount of time before the path was actually calculated.
\item Fixed a bug introduced in 4.\+1.\+18 which caused various rotation settings to be hidden in the inspector for the Rich\+AI component.
\item Fixed removing a movement script from the same component as an R\+V\+O\+Controller during runtime would not cause the R\+V\+O\+Controller to stop using the (now destroyed) movement script\textquotesingle{}s position for local avoidance calculations.
\item Fixed the Object\+Placer example script which is used in some example scenes would not always update the graph properly after destroying objects. In Unity object destruction is delayed until after the Update loop, but the script did not wait to update the graph until after the object had actually been destroyed. Thanks djzombie for reporting this.
\item Fixed recalculating a part of a recast graph using a graph update object would not expand the bounding box with the character radius to make sure that all tiles that could be affected by something inside the box were updated.
\item Worked around occational crashes when using R\+VO with the I\+L2\+C\+PP backend due to a bug in I\+L2\+C\+PP.
\item Fixed scanning a recast graph could throw an exception if there was a Recast\+Mesh\+Obj component attached to a Game\+Object with a Mesh\+Filter that had a null/missing mesh. Thanks ccm for finding the bug.
\item Fixed Flood\+Path throwing an exception when starting on a node that isn\textquotesingle{}t connected to any other node. Thanks Bulwark\+Studios for finding the bug.
\item Fixed applying optimizations (under the Optimizations tab) could cause several error messages to be logged about unsupported platforms in Unity 2018.\+1 or newer. Thanks N\+F\+Monster for reporting the issue.
\item Rotation speed and acceleration are now decoupled for A\+I\+Path and Rich\+AI. Previously the acceleration limited how quickly the agents could rotate due to how the math for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force}{\texttt{ centripetal acceleration}} works out. This was originally added in 4.\+1.\+11, but due to a typo the change was disabled. Now it is properly working.
\item Fixed Graph\+Modifier.\+On\+Graphs\+Post\+Update being called multiple times during a single update if multiple tiles were updated due to navmesh cutting. This can significantly improve performance if you are using many off-\/mesh links or you are using the R\+V\+O\+Navmesh component.
\item Fixed an edge case bug which could cause get nearest node queries on a newly scanned point graph to return older destroyed nodes.
\item Fixed work items throwing exceptions could cause some internal data to get into an invalid state.
\item Fixed tree colliders would not be rasterized correctly when using the recast graph and the tree prefabs had been scaled.
\item Fixed not finding graph types and graph editors from other assemblies than the one which contains the pathfinding system (important when using asmdef files).
\item Fixed \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a021f7aac9a2d2f76d4be29eea0c7c32e}{Astar\+Path.\+Flush\+Work\+Items}} always pausing the pathfinding threads even if no work items were queued.
\item Fixed loading navmesh graphs (and potentially in rare cases\+: recast graphs) from the cache or from a file could result in bad graph data which confused the funnel modifier which would create very zig-\/zaggy paths. If you have been experiencing this then just re-\/save your graphs/regenerate the cache after you have updated and then it should work as it should. Thanks Igor Aherne for reporting this.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+1.\+16 (2018-\/04-\/26)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed Point\+Node.\+Contains\+Connection could throw an exception if the node didn\textquotesingle{}t have any connections.
\item Fixed A\+I\+Lerp\textquotesingle{}s started out with a destination set to (0,0,0) instead of not having a destination set. So if you did not set a destination for it, it would try to move to the world origin.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+1.\+15 (2018-\/04-\/06)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed Rich\+A\+I.\+desired\+Velocity always being zero. Thanks sukrit1234 for finding the bug.
\item Added some video examples to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_adabb6114c1087142079534f593bfae82}{Pathfinding.\+A\+I\+Path.\+pick\+Next\+Waypoint\+Dist}}.
\item Fixed a bug introduced in 4.\+1.\+14 which caused scanning recast graphs in the Unity editor to fail with an error sometimes.
\item Fixed the position returned from querying the closest point on the graph to a point (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a7d49736e7a25f4cf9fc24bdbec862359}{Astar\+Path.\+Get\+Nearest}}) on layered grid graphs would always be the node center, not the closest point on the node\textquotesingle{}s surface. Thanks Kevin\+\_\+\+Jenkins for reporting this. This caused among other things the Closest\+On\+Node option for the Seeker\textquotesingle{}s Start\+End\+Modifier to be identical to the Snap\+To\+Node option.
\item Fixed R\+V\+O\+Controller.\+velocity being zero when the game was paused (Time.\+time\+Scale = 0).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+1.\+14 (2018-\/03-\/06)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed Pathfinding.\+Grid\+Node.\+Closest\+Point\+On\+Node being completely broken. Thanks Ivan for reporting this. This was used internally in some cases when pathfinding on grid graphs. So this fixes a few cases of strange pathfinding results too.
\item It is now possible to use pathfinding from editor scripts. See editor-\/mode (view in online documentation for working links).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+1.\+13 (2018-\/03-\/06)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed Layer\+Grid\+Graph.\+Get\+Node not performing out of bounds checks.
\item Exposed a public method \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_point_graph_a196e172067978f857152b90702c53579}{Pathfinding.\+Point\+Graph.\+Connect\+Nodes}} which can be useful if you are creating a graph from scratch using e.\+g Point\+Graph.\+Add\+Node.
\item Improved the multiple-\/agent-\/types (view in online documentation for working links) tutorial.
\item Improved the custom\+\_\+movement\+\_\+script (view in online documentation for working links) tutorial, among other things it can now also be followed if you are creating a 2D game. The movement script that you write has also been improved.
\item Improved how the Rich\+AI movement script keeps track of the node it is on. It should now be more stable in some cases, especially when the ground\textquotesingle{}s y-\/coordinate lines up badly with the y-\/coordinate of the navmesh.
\item Added an \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_a3a74e67c2f867f062595c26a804dc573}{Pathfinding.\+A\+I\+Path.\+constrain\+Inside\+Graph}} to A\+I\+Path for constraining the agent to be inside the traversable surface of the graph at all times. I think it should work everywhere without any issues, but please post in the forum if anything seems to break.
\item Fixed the proper fonts were not imported in the documentation html, so for many browsers it fell back to some other less pretty font.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+1.\+12 (2018-\/02-\/27)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed right clicking on array elements in the Unity inspector would bring up the \textquotesingle{}Show in online documentation\textquotesingle{} context menu instead of the Unity built-\/in context menu (which is very useful).
\item Navmesh assets used in the navmesh graph no longer have to be at the root of the Resources folder, they can be in any subfolder to the Resources folder.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+1.\+11 (2018-\/02-\/22)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You can now set which graphs an agent should use directly on the Seeker component instead of having to do it through code. \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}
\item Added tutorial for how to deal with agents of different sizes\+: multiple-\/agent-\/types (view in online documentation for working links).
\item Fixed scanning recast graphs could in rare cases throw an exception due to a multithreading race condition. Thanks emrys90 for reporting the bug.
\item Fixed a regression in 4.\+0.\+6 which caused position based penalty to stop working for layered grid graphs. Thanks DougW for reporting the bug.
\item Rotation speed and acceleration are now decoupled for A\+I\+Path and Rich\+AI. Previously the acceleration limited how quickly the agents could rotate due to how the math for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force}{\texttt{ centripetal acceleration}} works out.
\item Acceleration can now be set to a custom value on the A\+I\+Path class. It defaults to a \textquotesingle{}Default\textquotesingle{} mode which calculates an acceleration such that the agent reaches its top speed in about 0.\+4 seconds. This is the same behaviour that was hardcoded in earlier versions.
\item Fixed a bug in Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Utilities.\+Get\+Contours for grid graphs when the nodes parameter was explicitly passed as non null that could cause some contours not to be generated. Thanks andrew\+Beers for reporting the bug.
\item Improved documentation for \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_start_end_modifier_a6fc53558e2ff2516f9329a7515f37a0b}{Pathfinding.\+Start\+End\+Modifier.\+Exactness}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+1.\+10 (2018-\/01-\/21)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+1.\+0 through 4.\+1.\+9 were beta versions, all their changelogs have been merged into this one.
\item Upgrade notes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed the A\+I\+Path script with rotation\+In2D would rotate so that the Z axis pointed in the -\/Z direction instead of as is common for Unity 2D objects\+: to point in the +Z direction.
\item A\+LL classes are now inside the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} namespace to reduce potential naming collisions with other packages. Make sure you have \char`\"{}using Pathfinding;\char`\"{} at the top of your scripts. Previously most scripts have been inside the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} namespace, but not all of them. The exception is the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path}{Astar\+Path}} script to avoid breaking too much existing code (and it has a very distinctive name so name collisions are not likely).
\item Since the A\+PI for several movement scripts have been unified (see below), many members of the movement scripts have been deprecated. Your code should continue to work exactly as before (except bugs of course, but if some other behaviour is broken, please start a thread in the forum) but you may get deprecation warnings. In most cases the changes should be very easy to make as the visible changes mostly consist of renames.
\item A method called \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_a86eb322f611af919dad08b78e580edf4}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+Set\+Path}} has been added to all movement scripts. This replaces some hacks you could achieve by calling the On\+Path\+Complete method on the movement scripts from other scripts. If you have been doing that you should now call Set\+Path instead.
\item Paths calculated with a heuristic scale greater than 1 (the default is 1) might be slightly less optimal compared to before. See below for more information.
\item The Start\+End\+Modifier\textquotesingle{}s raycasting options are now only used if the \textquotesingle{}Original\textquotesingle{} snapping option is used as that\textquotesingle{}s the only one it makes sense for.
\item The Raycast\+Modifier has changed a bit, so your paths might look slightly different, however in all but very rare cases it should be at least as good as in previous versions.
\item Linecast methods will now assign the \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_pathfinding_1_1_graph_hit_info_abc12c1ed171ac07da6cd39a06e44e02a}{Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Hit\+Info.\+node}} field with the last node that was traversed in case no obstacle was hit, previously it was always null.
\item Multithreading is now enabled by default (1 thread). This may affect you if you have been adding the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path}{Astar\+Path}} component during runtime using a script, though the change is most likely positive.
\item The Dynamic\+Grid\+Obstacle component will now properly update the graph when the object is deactivated since the object just disappeared and shouldn\textquotesingle{}t block the graph anymore. Previously it only did this if the object was destroyed, not if it was deactivated.
\item If you have written a custom graph type you may have to change the access modifier on some methods. For example the Scan\+Internal method has been changed from being public to being protected.
\item Some internal methods on graphs have been hidden. They should never have been used by user code but in case you have done that anyway you will have to access them using the I\+Graph\+Internals or I\+Updatable\+Graph interface now.
\item Removed some compatibility code for Seekers for when upgrading from version 3.\+6.\+7 and earlier (released about 2 years ago). If you are upgrading from a version that old then the \textquotesingle{}Valid Tags\textquotesingle{} field on the Seeker component may get reset to the default value. If you did not use that field then you will not have to do anything.
\item A\+I\+Path now rotates towards actual movement direction when R\+VO is used.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Improvements
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved pathfinding performance by around 8\% for grid graphs, possibly more for other graph types. This involved removing a special case for when the pathfinding heuristic is not \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_heuristic}{\texttt{ admissable}} (in short, when A$\ast$ Inspector -\/$>$ Settings -\/$>$ Heuristic Scale was greater than 1). Now paths calculated with the heuristic scale greater than 1 might be slightly less optimal compared to before. If this is important I suggest you reduce the heuristic scale to compensate. Note that as before\+: a heuristic scale of 1 is the default and if it is greater than 1 then the calculated paths may no longer be the shortest possible ones.
\item Improved overall pathfinding performance by an additional 10-\/12\% by heavily optimizing some core algorithms.
\item Improved performance of querying for the closest node to a point when using the Point\+Graph and Pathfinding.\+Point\+Graph.\+optimize\+For\+Sparse\+Graph. The improvements are around 7\%.
\item Unified the A\+PI for the included movement scripts (A\+I\+Path, Rich\+AI, A\+I\+Lerp) and added a large number of nice properties and functionality.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+AI}} interface can now be used with all movement scripts.
\item To make it easier to migrate from Unity\textquotesingle{}s navmesh system, this interface has been designed to be similar to Unity\textquotesingle{}s Navmesh\+Agent A\+PI.
\item The interface has several nice properties like\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_a912fe97ee873d1e4a8bdb2217b72fb6c}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+remaining\+Distance}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_a0b4009cade4a25ddc760cacb6669805e}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+reached\+End\+Of\+Path}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_a8be62f7eda28b4111a46484248546e19}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+path\+Pending}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_adcdddcb7dfcaa7350c94a0ffd9d3532d}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+steering\+Target}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_adaf2a74d7f7e08c86987b969431304fb}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+is\+Stopped}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_a8e9b0c66a663e23b11e7466f6d5ffca3}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+destination}}, and many more.
\item You no longer need to set the destination of an agent using a Transform object, instead you can simply set the \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_a8e9b0c66a663e23b11e7466f6d5ffca3}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+destination}} property. Note that when you upgrade, a new A\+I\+Destination\+Setter component will be automatically created which has a \textquotesingle{}target\textquotesingle{} field. So your existing code will continue to work.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved behavior when A\+I\+Path/\+Rich\+AI characters move down slopes. Previously the way gravity was handled could sometimes lead to a \textquotesingle{}bouncing\textquotesingle{} behavior unless the gravity was very high. Old behavior on the left, new behavior on the right. 
\item Improved the grid graph inspector by adding preconfigured modes for different node shapes\+: square grids, isometric grids and hexagons. This also reduces clutter in the inspector since irrelevant options can be hidden. \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}
\item For 2D grid graphs the inspector will now show a single rotation value instead of a full 3D rotation which makes it a lot easier to configure.
\item Improved the performance of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_raycast_modifier}{Pathfinding.\+Raycast\+Modifier}} significantly. Common speedups on grid graphs range from 2x to 10x.
\item The Raycast\+Modifier now has a Pathfinding.\+Raycast\+Modifier.\+Quality quality. The higher quality options use a new algorithm that is about the same performance (or slightly slower) compared to the Raycast\+Modifier in previous versions however it often manages to simplify the path a lot more. The quality of the previous Raycast\+Modifier with default settings corresponds to somewhere between the Low and Medium qualities.
\item Improved support for Hi\+D\+PI (retina) screens as well as improved visual coherency for some icons. \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}
\item Improved the \textquotesingle{}eye\textquotesingle{} icon for when a graph\textquotesingle{}s gizmos are disabled to make it easier to spot.
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_grid_graph_a71e6787d661d1aebd990b028e18d117a}{Pathfinding.\+Grid\+Graph.\+Calculate\+Connections\+For\+Cell\+And\+Neighbours}}.
\item A\+I\+Path now works with point graphs in 2D as well (assuming the \textquotesingle{}rotate in 2D\textquotesingle{} checkbox is enabled).
\item Improved the performance of the R\+V\+O\+Navmesh component when used together with navmesh cutting, especially when many navmesh cuts are moving at the same time.
\item A warning is now displayed in the editor if one tries to use both the A\+I\+Destination\+Setter and Patrol components on an agent at the same time.
\item Improved linecasts on recast/navmesh graphs. They are now more accurate (there were some edge cases that previously could cause it to fail) and faster. Performance has been improved by by around 3x for longer linecasts and 1.\+4x for shorter ones.
\item Linecast methods will now assign the \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_pathfinding_1_1_graph_hit_info_abc12c1ed171ac07da6cd39a06e44e02a}{Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Hit\+Info.\+node}} field with the last node that was traversed in case no obstacle was hit.
\item Linecast on graphs now set the hit point to the endpoint of the line if no obstacle was hit. Previously the endpoint would be set to Vector3.\+zero. Thanks borluse for suggesting this.
\item Multithreading is now enabled by default (1 thread).
\item The Dynamic\+Grid\+Obstacle component now works with 2D colliders.
\item Clicking on the graph name in the inspector will no longer focus the name text field. To edit the graph name you will now have to click the Edit/\+Pen button to the right of the graph name. Previously it was easy to focus the text field by mistake when you actually wanted to show the graph settings. \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}
\item Reduced memory usage of the Point\+Graph when using Pathfinding.\+Point\+Graph.\+optimize\+For\+Sparse\+Graph.
\item Improved the Start\+End\+Modifier inspector slightly.
\item The Seeker inspector now has support for multi-\/editing.
\item The A\+I\+Path and Rich\+AI scripts now rotate to face the direction they are actually moving with when using local avoidance (R\+VO) instead of always facing the direction they want to move with. At very low speeds they fall back to looking the direction they want to move with to avoid jitter.
\item Improved the Seeker inspector. Unified the UI for setting tag penalties and determining if a tag should be traversable. \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}
\item Reduced string allocations for error messages when paths fail.
\item Added support for 2D physics to the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_raycast_modifier}{Pathfinding.\+Raycast\+Modifier}} component.
\item Improved performance of Graph\+Update\+Objects with update\+Physics=false on rotated navmesh/recast graphs.
\item Improved the inspector for A\+I\+Lerp.
\item R\+VO obstacles can now be visualized by enabling the \textquotesingle{}Draw Obstacles\textquotesingle{} checkbox on the R\+V\+O\+Simulator component. \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}
\item Reduced allocations in the funnel modifier.
\item Added a \textquotesingle{}filter\textquotesingle{} parameter to Pathfinding.\+Path\+Utilities.\+B\+FS and Pathfinding.\+Path\+Utilities.\+Get\+Reachable\+Nodes.
\item Added a method called \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_pathfinding_1_1_i_astar_a_i_a86eb322f611af919dad08b78e580edf4}{Pathfinding.\+I\+Astar\+A\+I.\+Set\+Path}} to all movement scripts.
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_graph_node_a0b534d78dbe2883face936a71cd76634}{Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Node.\+Graph}}.
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_mesh_node_aba387fc0f2e90ab2a5621f9ac9fa8790}{Pathfinding.\+Mesh\+Node.\+Contains\+Point(\+Vector3)}} in addition to the already existing Mesh\+Node.\+Contains\+Point(\+Int3).
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_mesh_node_af8c133b4f9c3baf713a6fe8cd41d2fa4}{Pathfinding.\+Mesh\+Node.\+Contains\+Point\+In\+Graph\+Space}}.
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_triangle_mesh_node_a8b7af27c9d4ebebeaf7720a36f34870c}{Pathfinding.\+Triangle\+Mesh\+Node.\+Get\+Vertices\+In\+Graph\+Space}}.
\item Added Pathfinding.\+Astar\+Data.\+Find\+Graph(predicate).
\item Added Pathfinding.\+Astar\+Data.\+Find\+Graph\+Which\+Inherits\+From(type).
\item Added a new class Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Utilities which has some utilities for extracting contours of graphs.
\item Added a new method \mbox{\hyperlink{}{Linecast(\+Grid\+Node\+Base,\+Grid\+Node\+Base)}} to the Grid\+Graph class which is much faster than the normal Linecast methods.
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_grid_graph_a0b612dc43efba20fe974711022552a7f}{Grid\+Graph.\+Get\+Node(int,int)}}.
\item Added Mesh\+Node.\+Add\+Connection(node,cost,edge) in addition to the already existing Add\+Connection(node,cost) method.
\item Added a \mbox{\hyperlink{}{setting to the navmesh graph for using the original mesh normals. This is useful for spherical/curved worlds.DocumentationAdded a documentation page on error messages\+: error-\/messages (view in online documentation for working links).Added a tutorial on how to create a wandering A\+I\+: wander (view in online documentation for working links).Added tutorial on bitmasks\+: bitmasks (view in online documentation for working links).You can now right-\/click on most fields in the Unity Inspector to bring up a link to the online documentation. \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}Various other documentation improvements and fixes.ChangesHeight or collision testing for grid graphs now never hits triggers, regardless of the Unity Physics setting \textquotesingle{}Queries Hit Triggers\textquotesingle{} which has previously controlled this.Seeker.\+Start\+Path will no longer overwrite the path\textquotesingle{}s graph\+Mask unless it was explicitly passed as a parameter to the Start\+Path method.The built in movement scripts no longer uses a coroutine for scheduling path recalculations. This shouldn\textquotesingle{}t have any impact for you unless you have been modifying those scripts.Replaced the Mine\+Bot\+AI script that has been used in the tutorials with Mine\+Bot\+Animation. The new script does not inherit from A\+I\+Path so in the example scenes there is now one A\+I\+Path component and one Mine\+Bot\+Animation script on each unit.Removed prompt to make the package support Unity\+Script which would show up the first time you used the package in a new project. Few people use Unity\+Script nowadays so that prompt was mostly annoying. Unity\+Script support can still be enabled, see javscript (view in online documentation for working links).If deserialization fails, the graph data will no longer be stored in a backup byte array to be able to be recovered later. This was not very useful, but more importantly if the graph data was very large (several megabytes) then Unity\textquotesingle{}s Undo system would choke on it and essentially freeze the Unity editor.The Start\+End\+Modifier\textquotesingle{}s raycasting options are now only used if the \textquotesingle{}Original\textquotesingle{} snapping option is used as that\textquotesingle{}s the only one it makes sense for.The Raycast\+Modifier.\+subdivide\+Every\+Iter field has been removed, this is now always enabled except for the lowest quality setting.The Raycast\+Modifier.\+iterations field has been removed. The number of iterations is now controlled by the quality field. Unfortunately this setting cannot be directly mapped to a quality value, so if you are upgrading all Raycast\+Modifier components will use the quality Medium after the upgrade.The default value for }} is now false.
\item Tiles are now enabled by default on recast graphs.
\item Modifiers now register/unregister themselves with the Seeker component during On\+Enable/\+On\+Disable instead of Awake/\+On\+Destroy. If you have written any custom modifiers which defines those methods you may have to add the \textquotesingle{}override\textquotesingle{} modifier to those methods and call base.\+On\+Enable/\+On\+Disable.
\item When paths fail this is now always logged as a warning in the Unity console instead of a normal log message.
\item Node connections now store which edge of the node shape that is used for that node. This is used for navmesh/recast graphs.
\item The Pathfinding.\+R\+V\+O\+Controller.\+velocity property on the R\+V\+O\+Controller can now be assigned to and that has the same effect as calling Force\+Set\+Velocity.
\item Deprecated the R\+V\+O\+Controller.\+Force\+Set\+Velocity method. You should use the velocity property instead.
\item All graphs now explicitly implement the I\+Updatable\+Graph interface. This is done to hide those methods (which should not be used directly) and thereby reduce confusion about which methods should be used to update graphs.
\item Hid several internal methods behind the I\+Graph\+Internals interface to reduce clutter in the documentation and Intelli\+Sense suggestions.
\item Removed Nav\+Graph.\+Unload\+Gizmo\+Meshes because it was not used for anything.
\item Since 4.\+0 individual graphs can be scanned using \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a9751550dc6954212dcb2e03aecafbcf6}{Astar\+Path.\+Scan}}. The older Nav\+Graph.\+Scan method now redirects to that method which is more robust. This may cause slight changes in behavior, however the recommendation in the documentation has always been to use \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a9751550dc6954212dcb2e03aecafbcf6}{Astar\+Path.\+Scan}} anyway so I do not expect many to have used the Nav\+Graph.\+Scan method.
\item Deprecated the Nav\+Graph.\+Scan\+Graph method since it just does the same thing as Nav\+Graph.\+Scan.
\item Deprecated the internal methods Path.\+Log\+Error and Path.\+Log.
\item Added the new internal method Path.\+Fail\+With\+Error which replaces Log\+Error and Log.
\item Made the A\+I\+Path.\+Try\+Search\+Path method private, it should never have been public to begin with.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed A\+I\+Path/\+Rich\+AI throwing exceptions in the Unity Editor when drawing gizmos if the game starts while they are enabled in a disabled game\+Object.
\item Fixed some typos in the documentation for Path\+Utilities.\+B\+FS and Path\+Utilities.\+Get\+Reachable\+Nodes.
\item For some point graph settings, path requests to points that could not be reached would fail completely instead of going to the closest node that it could reach. Thanks B\+Y\+E\+L\+IK for reporting this bug. If you for some reason have been relying on the old buggy behavior you can emulate it by setting A$\ast$ Inspector -\/$>$ Settings -\/$>$ Max Nearest Node Distance to a very low value.
\item Fixed connection costs were assumed to be equal in both directions for bidirectional connections.
\item Fixed a compiler error when building for U\+W\+P/\+Holo\+Lens.
\item Fixed some cases where circles used for debugging could have a much lower resolution than intended (Pathfinding.\+Util.\+Draw.\+Debug.\+Circle\+X\+Z).
\item Fixed R\+VO agents which were locked but some script sent it movement commands would cause the R\+VO system to think it was moving even though it was actually stationary, causing some odd behavior. Now locked agents are always treated as stationary.
\item Fixed R\+VO obstacles generated from graph borders (using the R\+V\+O\+Navmesh component) could be incorrect if a tiled recast graph and navmesh cutting was used. The bug resulted in an R\+VO obstacle around the tile that was most recently updated by a navmesh cut even where there should be no obstacle.
\item Fixed the R\+V\+O\+Navmesh component could throw an exception in some cases when using tiled recast graphs.
\item Fixed a regression in some 4.\+0.\+x version where setting Pathfinding.\+R\+V\+O\+Controller.\+velocity to make the agent\textquotesingle{}s movement externally controlled would not work properly (the system would always think the agent had a velocity of zero).
\item Fixed the Rich\+AI movement script could sometimes get stuck on the border between two tiles. (due to a possibility of division by zero that would cause its velocity to become NaN).
\item Fixed A\+I\+Path/\+Rich\+AI movement not working properly with rigidbodies in Unity 2017.\+3+ when the new physics setting \char`\"{}\+Auto Sync Transforms\char`\"{} was disabled. Thanks DougW for reporting this and coming up with a fix.
\item Fixed a few cases where Pathfinding.\+Rich\+AI would automatically recalculate its path even though Pathfinding.\+Rich\+A\+I.\+can\+Search was disabled.
\item Fixed some compiler warnings when using Unity 2017.\+3 or later.
\item Fixed graphical artifacts in the graph visualization line drawing code which could show up at very large coordinate values or steep viewing angles. Differential calculus can be really useful sometimes.
\item Fixed the Multi\+Target\+Path\+Example.\+cs (view in online documentation for working links).
\item Fixed the width/depth fields in the recast graph inspector causing warnings to be logged (introduced in 4.\+1.\+7). Thanks Nox\+Mortem for reporting this.
\item Fixed the \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_pathfinding_1_1_graph_hit_info_a3e01461305a554b148543ecac8d27ab7}{Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Hit\+Info.\+tangent\+Origin}} field was offset by half a node when using linecasting on grid graphs.
\item Fixed the A\+I\+Path script with rotation\+In2D would rotate so that the Z axis pointed in the -\/Z direction instead of as is common for Unity 2D objects\+: to point in the +Z direction.
\item Fixed the A\+I\+Lerp script with rotation\+In2D would rotate incorrectly if it started out with the Z axis pointed in the -\/Z direction.
\item Clamp recast graph bounding box size to be non-\/zero on all axes.
\item The Dynamic\+Grid\+Obstacle component will now properly update the graph when the object is deactivated since the object just disappeared and shouldn\textquotesingle{}t block the graph anymore. Previously it only did this if the object was destroyed, not if it was deactivated.
\item Fixed \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_lerp}{Pathfinding.\+A\+I\+Lerp}} ceasing to work properly if one of the paths it tries to calculate fails.
\item Fixed the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_funnel_modifier}{Pathfinding.\+Funnel\+Modifier}} could yield a zero length path in some rare circumstances when using custom node links. This could lead to an exception in some of the movement scripts. Thanks DougW for reporting the bug.
\item Fixed calling Seeker.\+Cancel\+Current\+Path\+Request could in some cases cause an exception to be thrown due to multithreading race conditions.
\item Fixed a multithreading race condition which could cause a path canceled by Seeker.\+Cancel\+Current\+Path\+Request to not actually be canceled.
\item Fixed a rare Array\+Out\+Of\+Bounds\+Exception when using the Funnel\+Modifier with the \textquotesingle{}unwrap\textquotesingle{} option enabled.
\item Fixed Seeker -\/$>$ Start End Modifier could not be expanded in the Unity inspector. Thanks Dee\+\_\+\+Lucky for reporting this.
\item Fixed a few compatiblity bugs relating to A\+I\+Path/\+Rich\+AI that were introduced in 4.\+1.\+0.
\item Fixed funnel modifier could sometimes fail if the agent started exactly on the border between two nodes.
\item Fixed another bug which could cause the funnel modifier to produce incorrect results (it was checking for colinearity of points in 2D instead of in 3D).
\item Fixed the funnel modifier would sometimes clip a corner near the end of the path.
\item Fixed Procedural\+Grid\+Mover would not detect user defined graphs that were subclasses of the Grid\+Graph class. Thanks viveleroi for reporting this.
\item Fixed enabling and disabling a A\+I\+Path or Rich\+AI component a very large number of times could potentially have a negative performance impact.
\item Fixed A\+I\+Path/\+Rich\+AI would continue searching for paths even when the component had been disabled.
\item Mesh\+Node.\+Contains\+Point now supports rotated graphs properly. Mesh\+Node is used in navmesh and recast graphs.
\item Fixed Linecast for navmesh and recast graphs not working for rotated graphs.
\item Fixed R\+V\+O\+Navmesh component not working properly with grid graphs that had height differences.
\item Fixed 2D R\+VO agents sometimes ignoring obstacles.
\item Fixed R\+V\+O\+Navmesh not removing the obstacles it had created when the component was disabled.
\item Fixed Raycast\+Modifier could miss obstacles when thick raycasting was used due to Unity\textquotesingle{}s Physics.\+Sphere\+Cast method not reporting hits very close to the start of the raycast.
\item In the free version the inspector for Raycast\+Modifier now displays a warning if graph raycasting is enabled since for all built-\/in graphs raycasts are only supported in the pro version.
\item Fixed some cases where the funnel modifier would produce incorrect results.
\item Fixed typo in a private method in the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path}{Astar\+Path}} class. Renamed the Update\+Graphs\+Interal method to Update\+Graphs\+Internal.
\item Fixed A\+I\+Path.\+remaining\+Distance and A\+I\+Path.\+target\+Reached could be incorrect for 1 frame when a new path had just been calculated (introduced in a previous beta release).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+0.\+11 (2017-\/09-\/09)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed paths would ignore the I\+Traversal\+Provider (used for the turn based utilities) on the first node of the path, resulting in successful paths where they should have failed.
\item Fixed Block\+Manager.\+Block\+Mode.\+All\+Except\+Selector could often produce incorrect results. Thanks Cquels for spotting the bug.
\item Fixed various bugs related to destroying/adding graphs that could cause exceptions. Thanks DougW for reporting this.
\item Fixed destroying a grid graph would not correctly clear all custom connections. Thanks DougW for reporting this.
\item Fixed the Multi\+Target\+Path did not reset all fields to their default values when using path pooling.
\item Added some additional error validation in the Multi\+Target\+Path class.
\item Fixed scanning a recast graph that was not using tiles using Unity 2017.\+1 or later on Windows could block indefinitely. Thanks David Drummond and ceebeee for reporting this.
\item Improved compatibility with Nintendo Switch. Thanks Noogy for the help.
\item Fixed Graph\+Update\+Scene would not handle the Game\+Object\textquotesingle{}s scale properly which could cause it to not update some nodes.
\item Fixed a regression in 4.\+0 which could cause the error to be omitted from log messages when paths failed.
\item Fixed several bugs relating to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_n_n_constraint_a5bf8143fe7fa47bf1520164350503bbf}{Pathfinding.\+N\+N\+Constraint.\+distance\+XZ}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_navmesh_base_a8247471c6dba57c8427abf5069451a5a}{Pathfinding.\+Navmesh\+Base.\+nearest\+Search\+Only\+XZ}}. Thanks koirat for reporting this.
\item Fixed scanning a graph that threw an error would prevent any future scans. Thanks Baste for reporting this.
\item Added a new get started video tutorial. See getstarted (view in online documentation for working links).
\item The Point\+Graph.\+node\+Count property is now protected instead of private, which fixes some compatibility issues.
\item Improved compatibility with Unity 2017.\+1, esp. when using the experimental .Net 4.\+6 target. Thanks Scott\+\_\+\+Richmond for reporting the issues.
\item Fixed Dynamic\+Grid\+Obstacle trying to update the graphs even when outside of play mode.
\item Fixed runtime error when targeting the Windows Store. Thanks cedtat for reporting the bug.
\item Fixed compilation error when targeting the Windows Store. Introduced in 4.\+0.\+3. Thanks cedtat for reporting the bug.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+0.\+10 (2017-\/05-\/01)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed compiler errors in the free version because the Manual\+R\+V\+O\+Agent.\+cs script being included by mistake. Thanks hummerbummer for reporting the issue.
\item Fixed Unity\textquotesingle{}s scene view picking being blocked by graph gizmos. Thanks Scott\+\_\+\+Richmond for reporting the bug.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+0.\+9 (2017-\/04-\/28)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Significantly improved performance and reduced allocations when recalculating indivudal recast tiles during runtime and there are terrains in the scene.
\item Fixed the Graph\+Update\+Scene inspector showing a warning for one frame after the \textquotesingle{}convex\textquotesingle{} field has been changed.
\item Fixed a few compiler warnings in Unity 5.\+6. Thanks Total\+Xep for reporting the issue.
\item Fixed graph drawing could generate large amounts of garbage due to a missing Get\+Hash\+Code override which causes Mono to have to allocate some dummy objects.
\item Fixed graph gizmo lines could be rendered incorrectly on Unity 5.\+6 on mac and possibly on Windows too.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+0.\+8 (2017-\/04-\/28)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_a3841d2c047e0f75d43fd95db3d0730fb}{Pathfinding.\+A\+I\+Base.\+rotation\+In2D}} to the A\+I\+Path script. It makes it possible to use the Y axis as the forward axis of the character which is useful for 2D games.
\item Exposed the Grid\+Graph.\+Layer\+Count property which works for both grid graphs and layered grid graphs (for grid graphs it always returns 1).
\item Made the Layer\+Grid\+Graph.\+layer\+Count field internal to discourage its use outside the Layer\+Grid\+Graph class.
\item Fixed exception when destroying some graph types (introduced in 4.\+0.\+6). Thanks unfalco for reporting the bug.
\item Fixed exception in Grid\+Graph.\+Get\+Nodes\+In\+Region when being called with an invalid rectangle or a rectangle or bounds object that was completely outside the graph. Thanks WillG for finding the bug.
\item Fixed A\+I\+Path/\+Rich\+AI not rotating to the correct direction if they started in a rotation such that the forward axis was perpendicular to the movement plane.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+0.\+7 (2017-\/04-\/27)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed 2D example scenes had their grids rotated by (90,0,0) instead of (-\/90,0,0). It doesn\textquotesingle{}t matter for those scenes, but the (-\/90,0,0) leads to more intuitive axis rotations for most use cases. Thanks Gelo\+Man for noticing this.
\item Renamed A\+I\+Simple\+Lerp to A\+I\+Lerp in the component menu as the documentation only refers to it by the name \textquotesingle{}A\+I\+Lerp\textquotesingle{}.
\item Added a new documentation page and video tutorial (pathfinding-\/2d) (view in online documentation for working links) showing how to configure pathfinding in 2D games.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+0.\+6 (2017-\/04-\/21)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed creating a Rich\+AI and in the same frame setting the target and calling Update\+Path would always result in that path being canceled.
\item Fixed a race condition which meant that if you called Rich\+A\+I.\+Update\+Path, A\+I\+Lerp.\+Search\+Path or A\+I\+Path.\+Search\+Path during the same frame that the agent was created then the callback for that path would sometimes be missed and the AI would wait indefinitely for it. This could cause the agents to sometimes never start moving.
\item Fixed adding a new graph while graph updates were running at the same time could potentially cause errors.
\item Added Nav\+Graph.\+exists which will become false when a graph has been destroyed.
\item Fixed Tile\+Handler\+Helper could throw exceptions if the graph it was tracking was destroyed.
\item Fixed Tile\+Handler\+Helper not detecting new Navmesh\+Cut or Navmesh\+Add components that were created before the Tile\+Handler\+Helper component was created or when it was disabled.
\item Tile\+Handler\+Helper no longer logs an error if it is created before a recast/navmesh graph exists in the scene and when one is created the Tile\+Handler\+Helper will automatically detect it and start to update it.
\item Fixed Tile\+Handler\+Helper could throw exceptions if the graph it was tracking changed dimensions.
\item Fixed recast graphs would always rasterize capsule colliders as if they had their \textquotesingle{}direction\textquotesingle{} setting set to \textquotesingle{}Y-\/axis\textquotesingle{}. Thanks emrys90 for reporting the bug.
\item The package now contains a \textquotesingle{}documentation.\+html\textquotesingle{} file which contains an offline version of the \textquotesingle{}Get Started\textquotesingle{} tutorial.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+0.\+5 (2017-\/04-\/18)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved compatibility with Opsive\textquotesingle{}s Behavior Designer -\/ Movement Pack (\href{https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/\#!/content/16853}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+assetstore.\+unity3d.\+com/en/\#!/content/16853}}).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The 4.\+0 update combined with the Movement Pack caused some compiler errors previously.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+0.\+4 (2017-\/04-\/17)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed the funnel modifier not working if \textquotesingle{}Add Points\textquotesingle{} on the Seeker\textquotesingle{}s Start End Modifier was enabled. Thanks Blaze\+\_\+\+Barclay for reporting it.
\item Fixed code typo in the write-\/modifiers (view in online documentation for working links) tutorial as well as made a few smaller improvements to it.
\item Fixed some cases where the Legacy\+R\+V\+O\+Controller would not behave like the R\+V\+O\+Controller before version 4.\+0.
\item Fixed Legacy\+A\+I\+Path not using the same custom inspector as the A\+I\+Path component.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+0.\+3 (2017-\/04-\/16)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved code style and improved documentation for some classes.
\item Reduced memory allocations a bit when using the Navmesh\+Add component.
\item Fixed graph types not necessarily being initialized when scanning the graph outside of play mode.
\item Fixed Layer\+Grid\+Graph not reporting scanning progress properly. This caused it to not work well with Scan\+Async and when scanning the graph in the editor the progress bar would only update once the whole graph had been scanned.
\item Removed the Debug\+Utility class which was only used for development when debugging the recast graph.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+0.\+2 (2017-\/04-\/16)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a minor bug in the update checker.
\item Deduplicated code for drawing circles and other shapes using Debug.\+Draw$\ast$ or Gizmos.\+Draw$\ast$ and moved this code to a new class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_util_1_1_draw}{Pathfinding.\+Util.\+Draw}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+0.\+1 (2017-\/04-\/15)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved how A\+I\+Path and Rich\+AI work with rigidbodies.
\item Added option for gravity to A\+I\+Path.
\item Removed the Rich\+A\+I.\+raycasting\+For\+Ground\+Placement field as it is automatically enabled now if any gravity is used.
\item A\+I\+Path and Rich\+AI now inherit from the same base class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base}{Pathfinding.\+A\+I\+Base}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 4.\+0 (2017-\/04-\/10)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Upgrade Notes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This release contains some significant changes. {\bfseries{It is strongly recommended that you back up your project before upgrading}}.
\item If you get errors immediately after upgrading, try to delete the Astar\+Pathfinding\+Project folder and import the package again. Sometimes Unity\+Packages will leave old files which can cause issues.
\item Moved some things to inside the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} namespace to avoid naming collisions with other packages. Make sure you have the line \textquotesingle{}using \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}};\textquotesingle{} at the top of your scripts. Some example scripts have been moved to the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding_1_1_examples}{Pathfinding.\+Examples}} namespace.
\item The R\+V\+O\+Controller component no longer handles movement as it turned out that was a bad idea. Having multiple components that handled movement (e.\+g Rich\+AI and R\+V\+O\+Controller) didn\textquotesingle{}t turn out well and it was very hard to configure the settings so that it worked well. The R\+V\+O\+Controller now exposes the Calculate\+Movement\+Delta method which allows other scripts to ask it how the local avoidance system thinks the character should move during this frame. If you use the Rich\+AI or A\+I\+Path components for movement, everything should work straight away. If you use a custom movement script you may need to change your code to use the Calculate\+Movement\+Delta method for movement. Some settings may need to be tweaked, but hopefully it should not be too hard.
\item Node connections are now represented using an array of structs (of type \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_pathfinding_1_1_connection}{Pathfinding.\+Connection}}) instead of one array for target nodes and one array for costs.
\item When upgrading an existing project legacy versions of the R\+V\+O\+Controller, Rich\+AI, A\+I\+Path and Graph\+Update\+Scene components will be used for compatibility reasons. You will have to click a button in the inspector to upgrade them to the latest versions. I have tried to make sure that the movement scripts behave the same as they did before version 4.\+0, but it is possible that there are some minor differences. If you have used a custom movement script which inherits from A\+I\+Path or Rich\+AI then the legacy components cannot be used automatically, instead the new versions will be used from the start.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item New Features And Improvements
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Local Avoidance
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The R\+VO system has been cleaned up a lot.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Agents will now always avoid walls and obstacles even if that would put them on a collision course with another agent. This helps with a previous problem of agents being able to be pushed into walls and obstacles (note that R\+V\+O\+Navmesh or R\+V\+O\+Square\+Obstacle still need to be used).
\item The R\+V\+O\+Simulator can now be configured for XZ space or XY space (2D).
\item The R\+V\+O\+Controller no longer handles movement itself as this turned out to be a really bad idea (see upgrade notes section).
\item The R\+V\+O\+Controller can now be used to stop at a target much more precisely than before using the Set\+Target method.
\item Agents are now Pathfinding.\+R\+V\+O.\+R\+V\+O\+Simulator.\+symmetry\+Breaking\+Bias biased towards passing other agents on the right side, this helps resolve some situations with a lot of symmetry much faster.
\item All fuzzy and hard to adjust parameters from the Pathfinding.\+R\+V\+O.\+R\+V\+O\+Simulator component have been removed. It should now be much easier to configure.
\item The Rich\+AI movement script now works a lot better with the R\+V\+O\+Controller. Previously the movement could be drastically different when the R\+V\+O\+Controller was used and local avoidance didn\textquotesingle{}t work well when the agent was at the edge of the navmesh.
\item Improved gizmos for the R\+V\+O\+Controller.
\item Added Pathfinding.\+R\+V\+O.\+R\+V\+O\+Controller.\+Force\+Set\+Velocity to use when you want agents to avoid a player (or otherwise externally controlled) character.
\item R\+VO agents can now have different priorities, lower priority agents will avoid higher priority agents more.
\item The neighbour distance field is now automatically calculated. This makes it easier to configure the agents and it will also improve performance slightly when the agents are moving slowly (for example in very crowded scenarios).
\item Added support for grid graphs to Pathfinding.\+R\+V\+O.\+R\+V\+O\+Navmesh.
\item Added a new example scene for R\+VO in 2D 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item General
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Huge increase in the performance of graph gizmos. This was accomplished by bypassing the Unity Gizmos and creating a custom gizmo rendererer that is able to retain the gizmo meshes instead of recreating them every frame (as well as using a lot fewer draw calls than Unity Gizmos). Therefore the graphs usually only need to check if the nodes have changed, and only if they have changed they will rebuild the gizmo meshes. {\bfseries{This may cause graph updates to seem like they introduce more lag than they actually do}} since a graph update will also trigger a gizmo rebuild. So make sure to always profile with gizmos disabled. For a 1000$\ast$1000 graph, which previously almost froze the editor, the time per frame went from over 4200 ms to around 90 ms when no nodes had changed. 
\item Improved the style of graph gizmos. A solid surface is now rendered instead of only the connections between the nodes. The previous mode of rendering only connections is of course still available. \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}
\item Added a new example scene showing how to configure hexagon graphs.
\item Added gizmos for hexagon graphs (grid graphs with certain settings). \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}
\item Implemented async scanning. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_ace889f7d491b7100be4db339466880e4}{Astar\+Path.\+active.\+Scan\+Async }} is an I\+Enumerable that can be iterated over several frames so that e.\+g a progress bar can be shown while calculating the graphs. Note that this does not guarantee a good framerate, but at least you can show a progress bar.
\item Improved behaviour of the A\+I\+Path movement script.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A\+I\+Path now works in the XY plane as well. In fact it works with any graph rotation. The Z axis is always the forward axis for the agent, so for 2D games with sprites you may have to attach the sprite to a child object which is rotated for it to show up correctly.
\item Previously the slowdown\+Distance had to be smaller than the forward\+Look field otherwise the character could slow down even when it had not reached the end of the path.
\item The agent should stop much more precisely at the end of the path now.
\item The agent now rotates with a fixed angular speed instead of a varying one as this is often more realistic.
\item Reduced the likelihood of the agent spinning around when it reaches the end of the path.
\item It no longer uses the forward\+Look variable. It was very tricky to set correctly, now the pick\+Next\+Waypoint\+Dist variable is used for everything instead and generally this should give you smoother movement.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved behaviour of the \mbox{\hyperlink{}{Rich\+AI }} movement script.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The agent should stop much more precisely at the end of the path now.
\item Reduced the likelihood of the agent spinning around when it reaches the end of the path.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Scanning the graph using \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a9751550dc6954212dcb2e03aecafbcf6}{Astar\+Path.\+Scan}} will now profile the various parts of the graph scanning process using the Unity profiler (Profiler.\+Begin\+Sample and Profiler.\+End\+Sample).
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_dynamic_grid_obstacle}{Dynamic\+Grid\+Obstacle }} will now update the graph immediately if an object with that component is created during runtime instead of waiting until it was moved for the first time.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_graph_update_scene}{Graph\+Update\+Scene }} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_graph_update_shape}{Graph\+Update\+Shape }} can now handle rotated graphs a lot better. The rotation of the object the Graph\+Update\+Scene component is attached to determines the \textquotesingle{}up\textquotesingle{} direction for the shape and thus which points will be considered to be inside the shape. The world space option had to be removed from Graph\+Update\+Scene because it didn\textquotesingle{}t really work with rotated graphs. The lock\+ToY option for Graph\+Update\+Scene has also been removed because it wasn\textquotesingle{}t very useful and after this change it would only have had an impact in rare cases.
\item Improved \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_graph_update_scene}{Graph\+Update\+Scene }} editor. When editing the points in the scene view it now shows helper lines to indicate where a new point is going to be added and which other points it will connect to as well as several other minor improvements. 
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_graph_update_scene}{Graph\+Update\+Scene }} now supports using the bounds from 2D colliders and the shape from Polygon\+Collider2D.
\item Added opaqueness slider for the gizmos under Inspector -\/$>$ Settings -\/$>$ Colors.
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_path_a7c90dc7a414ba9154785f8abda072d5d}{Path.\+Block\+Until\+Calculated }} which is identical to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a57ad57cd7356a7f9217516672e0a7bc9}{Astar\+Path.\+Block\+Until\+Calculated}}.
\item Added Seeker.\+Cancel\+Current\+Path\+Request.
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_nav_graph_a362fe9b5f2b34ce2072cd2fe3ae9df41}{Nav\+Graph.\+Get\+Nodes(System.\+Action$<$\+Graph\+Node$>$) }} which calls a delegate with each node in the graph. Previously Nav\+Graph.\+Get\+Nodes(\+Graph\+Node\+Delegate\+Cancelable) existed which did the same thing but required the delegate to return true if it wanted the graph to continue calling it with more nodes. It turns out this functionality was very rarely needed.
\item Individual graphs can now be scanned using \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a9751550dc6954212dcb2e03aecafbcf6}{Astar\+Path.\+Scan(\+Nav\+Graph)}} and other related overloads.
\item Improved \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_binary_heap}{priority queue }} performance. On average results in about a 2\% overall pathfinding performance increase.
\item Object\+Pool$<$\+T$>$ now requires a ref parameter when calling Release with an object to help prevent silly bugs.
\item \textquotesingle{}Min Area Size\textquotesingle{} has been removed. The edge cases are now handled automatically.
\item Added Object\+Pool\+Simple$<$\+T$>$ as a generic object pool (Object\+Pool$<$\+T$>$ also exists, but for that T must implement I\+Astar\+Pooled\+Object).
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_raycast_modifier}{Raycast\+Modifier }} now supports multi editing.
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_graph_node_a2b0bbdba619e80c979ae6e4baf70f153}{Graph\+Node.\+Random\+Point\+On\+Surface }}.
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_graph_node_a38397e222f65563d3db6d66e8aacbbbd}{Graph\+Node.\+Surface\+Area }}.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_pathfinding_1_1_int2}{Int2 }} and \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_pathfinding_1_1_int3}{Int3 }} now implement I\+Equatable for slightly better performance and fewer allocations in some places.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{}{Local\+Space\+Rich\+AI }} can now be used with any rotation (even things like moving on an object that is upside down).
\item The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_funnel_modifier}{funnel modifier }} can now handle arbitrary graphs (even graphs in the 2D plane) if the new \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_funnel_modifier_a01e517457a43758bc49d92f4a16e3430}{unwrap }} option is enabled.
\item The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_funnel_modifier}{funnel modifier }} can split the resulting path at each portal if the new \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_funnel_modifier_af7836aecb7f32833f46856b0b5d9752b}{split\+At\+Every\+Portal }} option is enabled.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Recast/\+Navmesh Graphs
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Recast graph scanning is now multithreaded which can improve scan times significantly.
\item Recast graph scanning now handles large worlds with lots of objects better. This can improve scan times significantly. 
\item Improved performance of nearest node queries for Recast/navmesh graphs.
\item Editing navmesh cut properties in the inspector now forces updates to happen immediately which makes editing easier.
\item Long edges in recast graphs are now split at tile borders as well as at obstacle borders. This can in particular help on terrain maps where the tile borders do not follow the elevation that well so the max edge length can be reduced to allow the border to follow the elevation of the terrain better.
\item Recast graphs can now be rotated arbitrarily.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Navmesh cutting still works!
\item The Rich\+AI script currently does not support movement on rotated graphs, but the A\+I\+Path script does.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved performance of navmesh cutting for large worlds with many tiles and Navmesh\+Add components.
\item Navmesh graphs and recast graphs now share the same base code which means that navmesh graphs now support everything that previously only recast graphs could be used for, for example navmesh cutting.
\item The Navmesh\+Cut inspector now shows a warning if no Tile\+Handler\+Helper component is present in the scene. A Tile\+Handler\+Helper component is necessary for the Navmesh\+Cuts to update the graphs.
\item Recast graphs now use less memory due to the B\+B\+Tree class now using around 70\% less memory per node.
\item Recast graphs now allocate slightly less memory when recalculating tiles or scanning the graph.
\item Cell height on Recast graphs is now automatically set to a good value.
\item Navmesh cutting is now a bit better at using object pooling to avoid allocations.
\item Tile\+Handler\+Helper now updates the tiles properly when one or multiple tiles on the recast graph are recalculated due to a graph update or because it was rescanned.
\item Navmesh cutting now uses more pooling to reduce allocations slightly.
\item Improved performance of loading and updating (using navmesh cutting) recast tiles with a large number of nodes.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Grid Graphs
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added Level\+Grid\+Node.\+X\+Coordinate\+In\+Grid, Level\+Grid\+Node.\+Z\+Coordinate\+In\+Grid, Level\+Grid\+Node.\+Layer\+Coordinate\+In\+Grid.
\item Added Grid\+Graph.\+Get\+Nodes\+In\+Region(\+Int\+Rect). Also works for layered grid graphs.
\item Layered grid graphs now have support for \textquotesingle{}Erosion Uses Tags\textquotesingle{}.
\item Added Grid\+Graph.\+Calculate\+Connections(\+Grid\+Node\+Base) which can be used for both grid graphs and layered grid graphs.
\item Grid graphs can now draw the surface and outline of the graph instead of just the connections between the nodes. The inspector now contains several toggles that can be used to switch between the different rendering modes.
\item The Procedural\+Grid\+Mover component now works with Layer\+Grid\+Graph as well.
\item Added Grid\+Graph.\+Recalculate\+Cell(x,y) which works both for grid graphs and layered grid graphs. This replaces the Update\+Node\+Position\+Collision method and that method is now deprecated.
\item Improved Grid\+Graph.\+Relocate\+Nodes which is now a lot more resilient against floating point errors.
\item Added dimetric (60°) to the list of default values for the isometric angle field on grid graphs.
\item Changing the width/depth of a grid graph will now keep the current pivot point at the same position instead of always keeping the bottom left corner fixed. (the pivot point can be changed to the center/bottom left/top left/top right/bottom right right next to the position field in the grid graph inspector)
\item Improved fluidity and stability when resizing a grid graph in the scene view. It now snaps to full node increments in size.
\item Grid graphs now display a faint grid pattern in the scene view even when the graph is not scanned to make it easier to position and resize the graph.
\item Improved styling of some help boxes in the grid graph inspector when using the dark UI skin.
\item The size of the unwalkable node gizmo (red cube) on grid graphs is now based on the node size to avoid the gizmos being much larger or much smaller than the nodes.
\item Implemented \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_b_path_a489105925d89af5221815659605dac6e}{special case for paths on grid graphs }} so that if you request a path to an unwalkable node with several walkable nodes around it, it will now not pick the closest walkable node to the requested target point and find a path to that but it will find the shortest path which goes to any of the walkable nodes around the unwalkable node. . This is a special case of the Multi\+Target\+Path, for more complicated configurations of targets the multi target path needs to be used to be able to handle it correctly.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Node connections are now represented using an array of structs (of type Connection) instead of one array for target nodes and one array for costs.
\item When scanning a graph in the editor, the progress bar is not displayed until at least 200 ms has passed. Since displaying the progress bar is pretty slow, this makes scanning small graphs feel more snappy.
\item Grid\+Graph and Layer\+Grid\+Graph classes now have a \textquotesingle{}transform\textquotesingle{} field instead of a matrix and inverse\+Matrix fields. The Graph\+Transform class also has various other nice utilities.
\item Moved mesh collecting code for Recast graphs to a separate class to improve readability.
\item Refactored out large parts of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path}{Astar\+Path}} class to separate smaller classes to improve readability and increase encapsulation.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a9715676ae64ec6f738c83b0c7c1ce7d7}{Astar\+Path.\+Register\+Safe\+Update}} is now implemented using Work\+Items. This yields a slightly different behavior (previously callbacks added using Register\+Safe\+Update would always be executed before work items), but that should rarely be something that you would depend on.
\item Replaced \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_ad346ba32beb7da19d030f5009d4cbb30}{Astar\+Path.\+Block\+Until\+Path\+Queue\+Blocked}} with the more robust \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a5eb2769ea83a0171c9cd0161544b211e}{Astar\+Path.\+Pause\+Pathfinding}} method.
\item The default radius, height and center for R\+V\+O\+Controllers is now 0.\+5, 2 and 1 respectively.
\item To reduce confusion. The second area color is now a greenish color instead of a red one. The red color would often be mistaken as indicating unwalkable nodes instead of simply a different connected component. Hopefully green will be a more neutral color.
\item Renamed \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_adda93f7f7219c99635bad43f1be71b6e}{Astar\+Path.\+astar\+Data}} to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a862c787d58adaf4c7b87b37a0c1aea83}{Astar\+Path.\+data}}.
\item Renamed Navmesh\+Cut.\+use\+Rotation and Navmesh\+Add.\+use\+Rotation to use\+Rotation\+And\+Scale (since they have always affected scale too).
\item Renamed Grid\+Graph.\+Generate\+Matrix to Grid\+Graph.\+Update\+Transform to be consistent with recast/navmesh graphs. The Generate\+Matrix method is now deprecated.
\item Renamed \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_ac46f3c7ee27f7e587a00f549a9a7118d}{Astar\+Path.\+Wait\+For\+Path}} to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a57ad57cd7356a7f9217516672e0a7bc9}{Astar\+Path.\+Block\+Until\+Calculated}}.
\item Renamed Grid\+Node.\+Get\+Connection\+Internal to Has\+Connection\+In\+Direction.
\item Renamed N\+N\+Info.\+clamped\+Position to N\+N\+Info.\+position.
\item Renamed Grid\+Graph.\+Get\+Nodes\+In\+Area to Get\+Nodes\+In\+Region to avoid confusing the word \textquotesingle{}area\textquotesingle{} for what is used to indicate different connected components in graphs.
\item Renamed A\+I\+Path.\+turning\+Speed to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_a7b098446f4a5661897899513e20b233e}{Pathfinding.\+A\+I\+Path.\+rotation\+Speed}}.
\item Deprecated Seeker.\+Get\+New\+Path.
\item Deprecated Nav\+Graph.\+matrix, Nav\+Graph.\+inverse\+Matrix, Nav\+Graph.\+Set\+Matrix and Nav\+Graph.\+Relocate\+Nodes(\+Matrix4x4,\+Matrix4x4). They have been replaced with a single transform field only available on some graph types as well as a few other overloads of teh Relocate\+Nodes method.
\item Changed the signature of Nav\+Graph.\+Get\+Nodes(\+Graph\+Node\+Delegate\+Cancelable) to the equivalent Nav\+Graph.\+Get\+Nodes(System.\+Func$<$\+Graph\+Node,bool$>$).
\item Replaced all instances of Graph\+Node\+Delegate with the equivalent type System.\+Action$<$\+Graph\+Node$>$.
\item Made a large number of previously public methods internal to reduce confusion about which methods one should use in a class and make the documentation easier to read. In particular the Path class has had its set of public methods reduced a lot.
\item Made Astar\+Data.\+Add\+Graph(\+Nav\+Graph) private. Scripts should use Astar\+Data.\+Add\+Graph(System.\+Type) instead.
\item Moved internal fields of N\+N\+Info into a new N\+N\+Info\+Internal struct to make the A\+PI easier to use. Previously N\+N\+Info contained some internal fields, but now they are only in N\+N\+Info\+Internal.
\item Moved Get\+Neighbour\+Along\+Direction to Grid\+Node\+Base and made it public.
\item An overload of the Grid\+Graph.\+Calculate\+Connections method has been made non-\/static.
\item Layer\+Grid\+Graph.\+Linked\+Level\+Node and Layer\+Grid\+Graph.\+Linked\+Level\+Cell are now private classes since they are only used by the Layer\+Grid\+Graph.
\item Mono\+Modifier.\+On\+Destroy is now a virtual function.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_ad713824531804d3622b2a156b0f1c2ea}{Astar\+Path.\+Is\+Using\+Multithreading}} and Numb\+Parallel\+Threads have been made non-\/static.
\item Astar\+Path.\+in\+Game\+Debug\+Path is now private.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_aae68bf9b08ca59b4007a1fde94c28ca0}{Astar\+Path.\+last\+Scan\+Time}} is now read only.
\item Removed the \textquotesingle{}climb axis\textquotesingle{} field from grid graphs. The axis is now automatically set to the graph\textquotesingle{}s UP direction (which is the only direction that makes sense and all other directions can be transformed to this one anyway).
\item Removed the \textquotesingle{}world\+Space\textquotesingle{} parameter from Recast\+Graph.\+Replace\+Tile, it is no longer possible to supply world space vertices to that method since graph space vertices are required for some things.
\item Removed B\+B\+Tree.\+Query\+Circle and B\+B\+Tree.\+Query since they were not used anywhere.
\item Removed the Path.\+search\+Iterations field because it wasn\textquotesingle{}t very useful even as debug information.
\item Removed the Path.\+max\+Frame\+Time field because it was not used.
\item Removed the Path.\+call\+Time property because it was not used.
\item Removed the A\+B\+Path.\+start\+Hint, A\+B\+Path.\+end\+Hint fields because they were not used.
\item Removed the A\+B\+Path.\+recalc\+Start\+End\+Costs field because it was not used.
\item Removed the Recursive\+Binary and Recursive\+Trinary modes for Rich\+A\+I.\+funnel\+Simplification because the Iterative mode was usually the best and fastest anyway (also the other two modes had a rare bug where they could get cought in infinite loops).
\item Removed the Polygon.\+Subdivide method because it was not used anywhere.
\item Removed the Nav\+Graph.\+Awake method because it was not used for anything.
\item Removed A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+O\+P\+T\+I\+M\+I\+Z\+E\+\_\+\+P\+O\+O\+L\+I\+NG from Optimization tab. It is now always enabled in standalone builds and always disabled in the Unity editor.
\item Removed various unused Recast code.
\item Removed support for forcing the inspector skin to be dark or light. The value provided by Editor\+G\+U\+I\+Utility.\+is\+Pro\+Skin is always used now.
\item Removed multiplication operator for Int3 with a Vector3 because it is a nonstandard operation on vectors (and it is not that useful).
\item Removed the since long deprecated example script A\+I\+Follow.
\item Removed the Adaptive\+Sampling algorithm for local avoidance. Only Gradient\+Descent is used now.
\item Removed empty Post\+Process method in Nav\+Mesh\+Graph.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed Rich\+AI and A\+I\+Path trying to use Character\+Controllers even if the Character\+Controller component was disabled.
\item Fixed rotated recast/navmesh graphs would ensure each node\textquotesingle{}s vertices were laid out clockwise in XZ space instead of in graph space which could cause parts of the graph to become disconnected from the rest.
\item Fixed a bug where graphs could fail to be deserialized correctly if the graph list contained a null element
\item Fixed a bug where the json serializer could emit True/\+False instead of true/false which is the proper json formatting.
\item Fixed Layer\+Grid\+Graphs\textquotesingle{} \char`\"{}max climb\char`\"{} setting not working properly with rotated graphs.
\item Fixed Layer\+Grid\+Graphs\textquotesingle{} \char`\"{}character height\char`\"{} setting not working properly with rotated graphs.
\item Fixed Layer\+Grid\+Graphs assuming there were no obstacles nearby if no ground was found.
\item Fixed Dynamic\+Grid\+Obstacle getting caught in an infinite loop if there was no \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path}{Astar\+Path}} component in the scene when it was created. Thanks Mei\+Chen for finding the bug.
\item Fixed Node\+Link2 deserialization causing exceptions if the node hadn\textquotesingle{}t linked to anything when it was serialized. Thanks Skalev for finding the bug.
\item Fixed the Alternative\+Path modifier could crash the pathfinding threads if it logged a warning since it used the Debug.\+Log(message,object) overload which can only be used from the Unity thread.
\item Fixed an issue where layer mask fields in graph editors would show \textquotesingle{}Nothing\textquotesingle{} if they only included layers which had no name set.
\item Fixed potential memory leak. Paths in the path pool would still store the callback which is called when the path has been calculated which that means it would implicitly hold a reference to the object which had the method that would be called. Thanks sehee for pointing this out.
\item Fixed Grid\+Node.\+Closest\+Point\+On\+Node could sometimes return the wrong y coordinate relative to the graph (in particular when the graph was rotated) and the y coordinate would not snap to the node\textquotesingle{}s surface.
\item Fixed Astar\+Data.\+Add\+Graph would fill {\itshape all} empty slots in the graph array with the graph instead of just the first. Thanks bitwise for finding the bug.
\item Improved compatibility with Unity 5.\+5 which was need due to the newly introduced Unity\+Engine.\+Profiling namespace.
\item Fixed graph updates on Layered\+Grid\+Graphs not respecting Graph\+Update\+Object.\+reset\+Penalty\+On\+Physics.
\item Fixed potential memory leak when calling Recalculate\+Cell on a layered grid graph.
\item Level\+Grid\+Node.\+Contains\+Connection now reports correct values (previously it would only check non-\/grid connections).
\item Fixed not being able to deserialize settings saved with some old versions of the A$\ast$ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} Project.
\item Tweaked List\+Pool to avoid returning lists with a very large capacity when a small one was requested as this could cause performance problems since Clear is O(n) where n is the capacity (not the size of the list).
\item Fixed Graph\+Update\+Scene causing \textquotesingle{}The Grid Graph is not scanned, cannot update area\textquotesingle{} to be logged when exiting play mode.
\item Fixed scanning a recast graph could in very rare circumstances throw a \textquotesingle{}You are trying to pool a list twice\textquotesingle{} exception due to a multithreading race condition.
\item Fixed recast/navmesh graphs could return the wrong node as the closest one in rare cases, especially near tile borders.
\item Fixed another case of recast/navmesh graphs in rare cases returning the wrong node as the closest one.
\item Fixed gizmo drawing with \textquotesingle{}Show Search Tree\textquotesingle{} enabled sometimes right after graph updates drawing nodes outside the search tree as if they were included in it due to leftover data from graph updates.
\item Fixed navmesh and recast graphs would unnecessarily be serialized by Unity which would slow down the inspector slightly.
\item Fixed Astar\+Enum\+Flag\+Drawer not working with private fields that used the \mbox{[}Serialize\+Field\mbox{]} attribute. This does not impact anything that the A$\ast$ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} Project used, but some users are using the Astar\+Enum\+Flag\+Drawer for other fields in their projects. Thanks Skalev for the patch.
\item Clicking \textquotesingle{}Apply\textquotesingle{} in the Optimizations tab will now always refresh the UI instead of assuming that a recompilation will happen (it will not happen if only defines for other platforms than the current one were modified).
\item Fixed not being able to multi-\/edit R\+V\+O\+Square\+Obstacle components.
\item Fixed Grid\+Node.\+Clear\+Connections(true) not removing all reversed connections and could sometimes remove the wrong ones.
\item Fixed Tile\+Handler\+Helper regularly checking for if an update needs to be done even if Tile\+Handler\+Helper.\+update\+Interval was negative even though the documentation specifies that it should not do that (it only disabled updates when update\+Interval = -\/1).
\item Fixed Path\+Utilities.\+Get\+Points\+Around\+Point\+World and Path\+Utilities.\+Get\+Points\+Around\+Point returning incorrect results sometimes.
\item Fixed Path.\+immediate\+Callback not being reset to null when using path pooling.
\item Tile\+Handler\+Helper will now work even if Scan On Awake in A$\ast$ Inspector -\/$>$ Settings is false and you are scanning the graph later.
\item Fixed Astar\+Work\+Item.\+init could be called multiple times.
\item Fixed some documentation typos.
\item Fixed colliders being included twice in the recast rasterization if the Game\+Object had a Recast\+Mesh\+Obj attached to it which effectively made Recast\+Mesh\+Obj not work well at all with colliders.
\item Fixed inspector for Recast\+Mesh\+Obj not updating if changes were done to the fields by a script or when an undo or redo was done.
\item Fixed Simple\+Smooth\+Modifier custom editor would sometimes set all instances of a field to the same value when editing multiple objects at the same time.
\item Fixed division by zero when the Time\+Scale was zero in the Astar\+Debugger class. Thanks Booil Jung for reporting the issue.
\item Various other small fixes in the Astar\+Debugger class.
\item Fixed division by zero when generating a recast graph and the cell size was much larger than the bounds of the graph.
\item Fixed the recast graph data structures could be invalid while a graph update was running in a separate thread. This could cause A\+PI calls like \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a7d49736e7a25f4cf9fc24bdbec862359}{Astar\+Path.\+Get\+Nearest}} to throw exceptions. Now the affected tiles are recalculated in a separate thread and then the updates are applied to the existing graph in the Unity thread.
\item Fixed some cases where the Alternative\+Path modifier would apply penalties incorrectly and possibly crash the pathfinding thread.
\item Fixed I\+Agent.\+Neighbour\+Count would sometimes not be reset to 0 when the agent was locked and thus takes into account no other agents.
\item Fixed R\+VO threads would sometimes not be terminated which could lead to memory leaks if switching scenes a lot.
\item Fixed Grid\+Graph.\+Get\+Nearest and Nav\+Graph.\+Get\+Nearest not handling constraint=null.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Internal changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item These are changes to the internals of the system and will most likely not have any significant externally visible effects.
\item Removed some wrapper methods for the heap in the Path\+Handler class since they were just unnecessary. Exposed the heap field as readonly instead.
\item Renamed Binary\+HeapM to Binary\+Heap.
\item Renamed Extra\+Mesh to Rasterization\+Mesh.
\item Refactored Tile\+Handler.\+Cut\+Poly to reduce code messiness and also fixed some edge case bugs.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Documentation
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Among other things\+: improved the writing-\/graph-\/generators (view in online documentation for working links) guide (among other things it no longer uses hard to understand calculations to get the index of each node).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+8.\+8.\+1 (2017-\/01-\/12)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed the \textquotesingle{}Optimization\textquotesingle{} tab sometimes logging errors when clicking Apply on Unity 5.\+4 and higher.
\item More U\+WP fixes (pro version only).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+8.\+8 (2017-\/01-\/11)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed errors when deploying for the Universal Windows Platform (U\+WP). This includes the Hololens platform.
\item It is no longer necessary to use the compiler directive A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+N\+O\+\_\+\+Z\+IP when deploying for U\+WP. zipping will be handled by the System.\+I\+O.\+Compression.\+Zip\+Archive class on those platforms (Zip\+Archive is not available on other platforms). If you have previously enabled A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+N\+O\+\_\+\+Z\+IP it will stay enabled to ensure compatibility.
\item Changed some comments from the \textquotesingle{}/$\ast$$\ast$$<$\textquotesingle{} format to \textquotesingle{}/$\ast$$\ast$\textquotesingle{} since Monodevelop shows the wrong docs when using the \textquotesingle{}/$\ast$$\ast$$<$\textquotesingle{} format.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+8.\+7 (2016-\/11-\/26)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved compatibility with Unity 5.\+5 which was needed due to the newly introduced Unity\+Engine.\+Profiling namespace.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+8.\+6 (2016-\/10-\/31)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Upgrade Notes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Note that a few features and some fixes that have been available in the beta releases are not included in this version because they were either not ready to be released or depended on other changes that were not ready.
\item Dropped support for Unity 5.\+1.
\item Moved some things to inside the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} namespace to avoid naming collisions with other packages. Make sure you have the line \textquotesingle{}using \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}};\textquotesingle{} at the top of your scripts.
\item Seeker.\+Start\+Multi\+Target\+Path will now also set the enabled\+Tags and tag\+Penalties fields on the path. Similar to what Start\+Path has done. This has been the intended behaviour from the start, but bugs happen. See \href{http://forum.arongranberg.com/t/multitargetpath-doesnt-support-tag-constraints/2561/3}{\texttt{ http\+://forum.\+arongranberg.\+com/t/multitargetpath-\/doesnt-\/support-\/tag-\/constraints/2561/3}}
\item The Json\+Fx library is no longer used, so the Pathfinding.\+Json\+Fx.\+dll file in the plugins folder may be removed to reduce the build size a bit. Unity\+Packages cannot delete files, so you have to delete it manually.
\item Recast\+Graph.\+Update\+Area (along with a few other functions) is now explicitly implemented for the I\+Updatable\+Graph interface as it is usually a bad idea to try to call those methods directly (use \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a6d6ca9490291366e24cde5ef10d23c30}{Astar\+Path.\+Update\+Graphs}} instead).
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a021f7aac9a2d2f76d4be29eea0c7c32e}{Astar\+Path.\+Flush\+Work\+Items}} previously had pretty bad default values for the optional parameters. By default it would not necessarily complete all work items, it would just complete those that took a single frame. This is pretty much never what you actually want so to avoid confusion the default value has been changed.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item New Features and Improvements
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Json\+Fx library is no longer used. Instead a very tiny json serializer and deserializer has been written. In addition to reducing code size and being slightly faster, it also means that users using Windows Phone no longer have to use the A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+N\+O\+\_\+\+J\+S\+ON compiler directive. I do not have access to a windows phone however, so I have not tested to build it for that platform. If any issues arise I would appreciate if you post them in the forum.
\item Improved inspector for Navmesh\+Cut.
\item Node\+Link2 can now be used even when using cached startup or when loading serialized data in other ways just as long as the Node\+Link2 components are still in the scene.
\item Level\+Grid\+Node now has support for custom non-\/grid connections (just like Grid\+Node has).
\item Added Grid\+Node.\+X\+Coordinate\+In\+Grid and Grid\+Node.\+Z\+Coordinate\+In\+Grid.
\item Improved documentation for Graph\+Update\+Shape a bit.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed Editor\+Utilities.\+Get\+Md5\+Hash since it was not used anywhere.
\item Deprecated Tile\+Handler.\+Get\+Tile\+Type and Tile\+Handler.\+Get\+Tile\+Type\+Count.
\item Seeker.\+Start\+Path now properly handles Multi\+Target\+Path objects as well.
\item Seeker.\+Start\+Multi\+Target\+Path is now deprecated. Note that it will now also set the enabled\+Tags and tag\+Penalties fields on the path. Similar to what Start\+Path has done.
\item Removed Grid\+Graph.\+bounds since it was not used or set anywhere.
\item Graph\+Node.\+Add\+Connection will now throw an Argument\+Null\+Exception if you try to call it with a null target node.
\item Made Point\+Graph.\+Add\+Children and Point\+Graph.\+Count\+Children protected since it makes no sense for them to be called by other scripts.
\item Changed how the \textquotesingle{}Save \& Load\textquotesingle{} tab looks to make it easier to use.
\item Renamed \textquotesingle{}Path Debug Mode\textquotesingle{} to \textquotesingle{}Graph Coloring\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}Path Log Mode\textquotesingle{} to \textquotesingle{}Path Logging\textquotesingle{} in the inspector.
\item Recast\+Graph.\+Update\+Area (along with a few other functions) is now explicitly implemented for the I\+Updatable\+Graph interface as it is usually a bad idea to try to call those methods directly (use \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a6d6ca9490291366e24cde5ef10d23c30}{Astar\+Path.\+Update\+Graphs}} instead).
\item Removed Connection\+Type enum since it was not used anywhere.
\item Removed Node\+Delegate and Get\+Next\+Target\+Delegate since they were not used anywhere.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed Tiny\+Json not using culture invariant float parsing and printing. This could cause deserialization errors on systems that formatted floats differently.
\item Fixed the Ending\+Condition example script.
\item Fixed speed being multiplied by Time.\+delta\+Time in the AI script in the get started tutorial when it shouldn\textquotesingle{}t have been.
\item Fixed Funnel\+Modifier could for some very short paths return a straight line even though a corner should have been inserted.
\item Fixed typo. \textquotesingle{}Descent\textquotesingle{} (as in \textquotesingle{}Gradient Descent\textquotesingle{}) was spelled as \textquotesingle{}Decent\textquotesingle{} in some cases. Thanks Brad Grimm for finding the typo.
\item Fixed some documentation typos.
\item Fixed some edge cases in Random\+Path and Flee\+Path where a node outside the valid range of G scores could be picked in some cases (when it was not necessary to do so).
\item Fixed editor scripts in some cases changing the editor gui styles instead of copying them which could result in headers in unrelated places in the Unity UI had the wrong sizes. Thanks HP for reporting the bug.
\item Fixed Navmesh\+Cut causing errors when cutting the navmesh if it was rotated upside down or scaled with a negative scale.
\item Fixed Triangle\+Mesh\+Node.\+Closest\+Point\+On\+Node\+XZ could sometimes return the wrong point (still on the node surface however). This could lead to characters (esp. when using the Rich\+AI component) teleporting in rare cases. Thanks Lord\+Cecil for reporting the bug.
\item Fixed Grid\+Nodes not serializing custom connections.
\item Fixed nodes could potentially get incorrect graph indices assigned when additive loading was used.
\item Added proper error message when trying to call Recast\+Graph.\+Replace\+Tile with a vertex count higher than the upper limit.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Known Bugs
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Calling Get\+Nearest when a recast graph is currently being updated on another thread may in some cases result in a null reference exception being thrown. This does not impact navmesh cutting. This bug has been present (but not discovered) in previous releases as well.
\item Calling Get\+Nearest on point graphs with \textquotesingle{}optimize\+For\+Sparse\+Graph\textquotesingle{} enabled may in some edge cases return the wrong node as being the closest one. It will not be widely off target though and the issue is pretty rare, so for real world use cases it should be fine. This bug has been present (but not discovered) in previous releases as well.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+8.\+3 through 3.\+8.\+5 were beta versions
\item 3.\+8.\+2 (2016-\/02-\/29)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improvements
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Dynamic\+Grid\+Obstacle now handles rotation and scaling better.
\item Reduced allocations due to coroutines in Dynamic\+Grid\+Obstacle.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_ad81634e62019b66a8c2414b6b186e501}{Astar\+Path.\+limit\+Graph\+Updates}} not working properly most of the time. In order to keep the most common behaviour after the upgrade, the value of this field will be reset to false when upgrading.
\item Fixed Dynamic\+Grid\+Obstacle not setting the correct bounds at start, so the first move of an object with the Dynamic\+Grid\+Obstacle component could leave some nodes unwalkable even though they should not be. Thanks Dima for reporting the bug.
\item Fixed Dynamic\+Grid\+Obstacle stopping to work after the Game\+Object it is attached to is deactivated and then activated again.
\item Fixed R\+V\+O\+Controller not working after reloading the scene due to the C\# \textquotesingle{}??\textquotesingle{} operator not being equivalent to checking for \textquotesingle{}== null\textquotesingle{} (it doesn\textquotesingle{}t use Unity\textquotesingle{}s special comparison check). Thanks Khan-\/amil for reporting the bug.
\item Fixed typo in documentation for Procedural\+Grid\+Mover.\+flood\+Fill.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Renamed \textquotesingle{}Max Update Frequency\textquotesingle{} to \textquotesingle{}Max Update Interval\textquotesingle{} in the editor since it has the unit \mbox{[}second\mbox{]}, not \mbox{[}1/second\mbox{]}.
\item Renamed \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_ad81634e62019b66a8c2414b6b186e501}{Astar\+Path.\+limit\+Graph\+Updates}} to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a5db862f4ebf5c7d71fbacfb9625f24ee}{Astar\+Path.\+batch\+Graph\+Updates}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a3398d8c7c4aaadf7fdc57c2c213a9fdf}{Astar\+Path.\+max\+Graph\+Update\+Freq}} to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_ae485e075f508464fe3ec27761dd52d7d}{Astar\+Path.\+graph\+Update\+Batching\+Interval}}. Hopefully these new names are more descriptive. The documentation for the fields has also been improved slightly.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+8.\+1 (2016-\/02-\/17)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improvements
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The tag visualization mode for graphs can now use the custom list of colors that can be configured in the inspector. Thanks Arakade for the patch.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Recast graphs now handle meshes and colliders with negative scales correctly. Thanks bvance and peted for reporting it.
\item Fixed Grid\+Graph\+Editor throwing exceptions when a user had created a custom grid graph class which inherits from Grid\+Graph.
\item Fixed Seeker.\+post\+Process\+Path not being called properly. Instead it would throw an exception if the post\+Process\+Path delegate was set to a non-\/null value. Thanks Code\+Speaker for finding the bug.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+8 (2016-\/02-\/16)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The last version released on the Unity Asset Store was 3.\+7, so if you are upgrading from that version check out the release notes for 3.\+7.\+1 through 3.\+7.\+5 as well.
\item Breaking Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For the few users that have written their own Path Modifiers. The \textquotesingle{}source\textquotesingle{} parameter to the Apply method has been removed from the I\+Path\+Modifier interface. You will need to remove that parameter from your modifiers as well.
\item Modifier priorities have been removed and the priorities are now set to sensible hard coded values since at least for the included modifiers there really is only one ordering that makes sense (hopefully there is no use case I have forgotten). This may affect your paths if you have used some other modifier order. Hopefully this change will reduce confusion for new users.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item New Features and Improvements
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added Node\+Connection mode to the Start\+End\+Modifier on the Seeker component. This mode will snap the start/end point to a point on the connections of the start/end node. Similar to the Interpolate mode, but more often does what you actually want.
\item Simple\+Smooth\+Modifier now has support for multi editing.
\item Added a new movement script called A\+I\+Lerp which uses linear interpolation to follow the path. This is good for games which want the agent to follow the path exactly and not use any physics like behaviour. This movement script works in both 2D and 3D.
\item Added a new 2D example scene which uses the new A\+I\+Lerp movement script.
\item All scripts now have a \href{http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/HelpURLAttribute.html}{\texttt{ Help\+U\+R\+L\+Attribute}} so the documentation button at the top left corner of every script inspector now links directly to the documentation.
\item Recast graphs can now draw the surface of a navmesh in the scene view instead of only the node outlines. Enable it by checking the \textquotesingle{}Show mesh surface\textquotesingle{} toggle in the inspector. Drawing the surface instead of the node outlines is usually faster since it does not use Unity Gizmos which have to rebuild the mesh every frame.
\item Improved G\+UI for the tag mask field on the Seeker.
\item All code is now consistently formatted, utilising the excellent Uncrustify tool.
\item Added animated gifs to the \mbox{\hyperlink{}{Recast graph }} documentation showing how some parameters change the resulting navmesh. If users like this, I will probably follow up and add similar gifs for variables in other classes. \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed objects in recast graphs being rasterized with an 0.\+5 voxel offset. Note that this will change how your navmesh is rasterized (but usually for the better), so you may want to make sure it still looks good.
\item Fixed graph updates to navmesh and recast graphs not checking against the y coordinate of the bounding box properly (introduced in 3.\+7.\+5).
\item Fixed potential bug when loading graphs from a file and one or more of the graphs were null.
\item Fixed invalid data being saved when calling Astar\+Serializer.\+Serialize\+Graphs with an array that was not equal to the Astar\+Data.\+graphs array. The Astar\+Serializer is mostly used internally (and internally it is always called with the Astar\+Data.\+graphs array). Thanks munkman for reporting this.
\item Fixed incorrect documentation for Grid\+Node.\+Node\+In\+Grid\+Index. Thanks mfjk for reporting it!
\item Fixed typo in a recast graph log message (where -\/$>$ were). Thanks bigdaddio for reporting it!
\item Fixed not making sure the file is writable before writing graph cache files (Perforce could sometimes make it read-\/only). Thanks Jørgen Tjernø for the patch.
\item Fixed R\+V\+O\+Controller always using Find\+Object\+Of\+Type during Awake, causing performance issues in large scenes. Thanks Jørgen Tjernø for the patch.
\item Removed Quadtree\+Graph, Astar\+Parallel, Nav\+Mesh\+Renderer and Navmesh\+Controller from the released version. These were internal dev files but due to typos they had been included in the release. It will also automatically refresh itself if the graph has been rescanned with a different number of tiles.
\item Fixed Simple\+Smooth\+Modifier not always including the exact start point of the path.
\item Fixed A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+G\+R\+I\+D\+\_\+\+N\+O\+\_\+\+C\+U\+S\+T\+O\+M\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+N\+E\+C\+T\+I\+O\+NS being stripped out of the final build, so that entry in the Optimizations tab didn\textquotesingle{}t actually do anything.
\item Fixed performance issue with path pooling. If many paths were being calculated and pooled, the performance could be severely reduced unless A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+O\+P\+T\+I\+M\+I\+Z\+E\+\_\+\+P\+O\+O\+L\+I\+NG was enabled (which it was not by default).
\item Fixed 3 compiler warnings about using some deprecated Unity methods.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Recast graphs\textquotesingle{} \textquotesingle{}Snap To Scene\textquotesingle{} button now snaps to the whole scene instead of the objects that intersect the bounds that are already set. This has been a widely requested change. Thanks Jørgen Tjernø for the patch.
\item Moved various Astar\+Math functions to the new class Vector\+Math and renamed some of them to reduce confusion.
\item Removed various Astar\+Math functions because they were either not used or they already exist in e.\+g Mathf or System.\+Math. Distance\+Point\+Segment2, Compute\+Vertex\+Hash, Hermite, Map\+To\+Range, Format\+Bytes, Magnitude\+XZ, Repeat, Abs, Min, Max, Sign, Clamp, Clamp01, Lerp, Round\+To\+Int.
\item Path\+Ending\+Condition (used with X\+Path) is now abstract since it doesn\textquotesingle{}t really make any sense to use the default implementation (always returns true).
\item A \textquotesingle{}Recyle\textquotesingle{} method is no longer required on path classes (reduced boilerplate).
\item Removed old I\+Funnel\+Graph interface since it was not used by anything.
\item Removed old Convex\+Mesh\+Node class since it was not used by anything.
\item Removed old script Navmesh\+Controller since it has been disabled since a few versions.
\item Removed Int3.\+Div\+By2, Int3.\+unsafe\+Sqr\+Magnitude and Int3.\+Normalize\+To since they were not used anywere.
\item Removed Int2.\+sqr\+Magnitude, Int2.\+Dot since they were not used anywhere and are prone to overflow (use sqr\+Magnitude\+Long/\+Dot\+Long instead)
\item Deprecated Int2.\+Rotate since it was not used anywhere.
\item Deprecated Int3.\+world\+Magnitude since it was not used anywhere.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+7.\+5 (2015-\/10-\/05)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Breaking changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Graph updates to navmesh and recast graphs now also check that the nodes are contained in the supplied bounding box on the Y axis. If the bounds you have been using were very short along the Y axis, you may have to change them so that they cover the nodes they should update.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Improvements
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added Grid\+Node.\+Closest\+Point\+On\+Node.
\item Optimized Grid\+Graph.\+Calculate\+Connections by approximately 20\%. This means slightly faster scans and graph updates.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Graph updates to navmesh and recast graphs now also check that the nodes are contained in the supplied bounding box on the Y axis. If the bounds you have been using were very short along the Y axis, you may have to change them so that they cover the nodes they should update.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed stack overflow exception when a pivot root with no children was assigned in the heuristic optimization settings.
\item Fixed scanning in the editor could sometimes throw exceptions on new versions of Unity. Exceptions contained the message \char`\"{}\+Trying to initialize a node when it is not safe to initialize any node\char`\"{}. This happened because Unity changed the Editor\+G\+U\+I\+Utility.\+Display\+Progress\+Bar function to also call On\+Scene\+G\+UI and On\+Draw\+Gizmos and that interfered with the scanning.
\item Fixed paths could be returned with invalid nodes if the path was calculated right before a call to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a9751550dc6954212dcb2e03aecafbcf6}{Astar\+Path.\+Scan()}} was done. This could result in the funnel modifier becoming really confused and returning a straight line to the target instead of avoiding obstacles.
\item Fixed sometimes not being able to use the Optimizations tab on newer versions of Unity.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+7.\+4 (2015-\/09-\/13)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A\+I\+Path now uses the cached transform field in all cases for slightly better performance.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed recast/navmesh graphs could in rare cases think that a point on the navmesh was in fact not on the navmesh which could cause odd paths and agents teleporting short distances.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Documentation Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed the Seeker class not appearing in the documentation due to a bug in Doxygen (documentation generator).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+7.\+3 (2015-\/08-\/18)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed Grid\+Graph-\/$>$Unwalkable When No Ground used the negated value (true meant false and false meant true). This bug was introduced in 3.\+7 when some code was refactored. Thanks Drowning\+Monkeys for reporting it.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+7.\+2 (2015-\/08-\/06)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed penalties not working on navmesh based graphs (navmesh graphs and recast graphs) due to incorrectly configured compiler directives.
\item Removed undocumented compiler directive A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+S\+T\+A\+N\+T\+\_\+\+P\+E\+N\+A\+L\+TY and replaced with A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+N\+O\+\_\+\+T\+R\+A\+V\+E\+R\+S\+A\+L\+\_\+\+C\+O\+ST which can strip out code handling penalties to get slightly better pathfinding performance (still not documented though as it is not really a big performance boost).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+7.\+1 (2015-\/08-\/01)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed a few cases where exceptions where needed to better support Web\+GL when exception handling is disabled.
\item Fixed Multi\+Target\+Path could return the wrong path if the target of the path was the same as the start point.
\item Fixed Multi\+Target\+Path could sometimes throw exceptions when using more than one pathfinding thread.
\item Multi\+Target\+Path will now set path and vector\+Path to the shortest path even if paths\+For\+All is true.
\item The log output for Multi\+Target\+Path now contains the length (in nodes) of the shortest path.
\item Fixed Recast\+Graph throwing exceptions when trying to rasterize trees with missing (null) prefabs. Now they will simply be ignored.
\item Removed Recast\+Graph.\+bb\+Tree since it was not used for anything (bb\+Trees are stored inside each tile since a few versions)
\item Improved performance of loading and updating large recast graph tiles (improved performance of internal A\+A\+BB tree).
\item Removed support for the compiler directive A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+O\+L\+D\+\_\+\+B\+B\+T\+R\+EE.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+7 (2015-\/07-\/22)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The last version that was released on the Unity Asset Store was version 3.\+6 so if you are upgrading from that version also check out the release notes for 3.\+6.\+1 through 3.\+6.\+7.
\item Upgrade notes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Procedural\+Grid\+Mover.\+update\+Distance is now in nodes instead of world units since this value is a lot less world scale dependant. So the defaults should fit more cases. You may have to adjust it slightly.
\item Some old parts of the A\+PI that has been marked as deprecated long ago have been removed (see below). Some other unused parts of the A\+PI that mostly lead to confusion have been removed as well.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Improvements
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rewrote several documentation pages to try to explain concepts better and fixed some old code.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item accessing-\/data (view in online documentation for working links)
\item graph-\/updates (view in online documentation for working links)
\item writing-\/graph-\/generators (view in online documentation for working links)
\item Pathfinding.\+Navmesh\+Cut
\item And some other smaller changes.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added an overload of Pathfinding.\+Path\+Utilities.\+Is\+Path\+Possible which takes a tag mask.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{}{X\+Path }} now works again.
\item The Procedural\+Grid\+Mover component now supports rotated graphs (and all other ways you can transform it, e.\+g isometric angle and aspect ratio).
\item Rewrote Grid\+Graph.\+Linecast to be more accurate and more performant. Previously it used a sampling approach which could cut corners of obstacles slightly and was pretty inefficient.
\item Linted lots of files to remove trailing whitespace, fix imports, use \textquotesingle{}var\textquotesingle{} when relevant and various other small tweaks.
\item Added Astar\+Data.\+layer\+Grid\+Graph shortcut.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed compilation errors for Windows Store. The errors mentioned Thread\+Priority and Volatile\+Read.
\item Fixed Layer\+Grid\+Graph.\+Get\+Nearest sometimes returning the wrong node inside a cell (e.\+g sometimes it would always return the node with the highest y coordinate).~\newline
 This did not happen when the node size was close to 1 and the grid was positioned close to the origin. Which it of course was in all my tests (tests are improved now).
\item Fixed Grid\+Graph.\+Linecast always returning false (no obstacles) when the start point and end point was the same. Now it returns true (obstacle) if the start point was inside an obstacle which makes more sense.
\item Linecasts on layered grid graphs now use the same implementation as the normal grid graph.~\newline
 This fixed a T\+ON of bugs. If you relied on the old (buggy) behaviour you might have to change your algorithms a bit. It will now report more accurate hit information as well.
\item Fixed documentation on Layer\+Grid\+Graph.\+Linecast saying that it would return false if there was an obstacle in the way when in fact exactly the opposite was true.
\item Fixed inspector G\+UI throwing exceptions when two or more grid graphs or layered grid graphs were visible and thick\+Raycast was enabled on only one of them.
\item Fixed a few options only relevant for grid graphs were visible in the layered grid graph inspector as well.
\item Fixed Grid\+Graph.\+Check\+Connection returned the wrong result when neighbours was Four and dir was less than 4.
\item All compiler directives in the Optimizations tab are now tested during the package build phase. So hopefully none of them should give compiler errors now.
\item Improved accuracy of intellisense by changing the start of some documentation comments to /$\ast$$\ast$ instead of /$\ast$$\ast$$<$ as the later type is handled well by doxygen but apparently not so well by Mono\+Develop and VS.
\item Fixed the editor sometimes incorrectly comparing versions which could cause the \textquotesingle{}New Update\textquotesingle{} window to appear even though no new version was available.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed code only necessary for compatibility with Unity 4.\+5 and lower.
\item Removed a lot of internal unused old code.
\item Renamed Grid\+Graph.\+Get\+Node\+Position to Grid\+Graph.\+Graph\+Point\+To\+World to avoid confusion.
\item Renamed 3rd party plugin license files to prevent the Unity Asset Store from detecting those as the license for the whole package.
\item Changed Seeker.\+traversable\+Tags to be a simple int instead of a class.
\item Grid\+Node and Level\+Grid\+Node now inherit from a shared base class called Grid\+Node\+Base.
\item Removed support for the compiler directive Configure\+Tags\+As\+Multiple since it was not supported by the whole codebase and it was pretty old.
\item Marked a few methods in Astar\+Data as deprecated since they used strings instead of types. If string to type conversion is needed it should be done elsewhere.
\item Removed some methods which have been marked as obsolete for a very long time.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Astar\+Data.\+Get\+Node
\item Path\+Modifier and Mono\+Modifier.\+Apply\+Original
\item Some old variants of Path\+Modifier.\+Apply
\item Grid\+Generator\+Editor.\+Resources\+Field
\item Int3.\+safe\+Magnitude and safe\+Sqr\+Magnitude
\item Graph\+Update\+Utilities.\+Is\+Path\+Possible (this has been since long been moved to the Path\+Utilities class)
\item All constructors on path classes. The static Construct method should be used instead since that can handle path pooling.
\item Graph\+Node.\+Position, walkable, tags, graph\+Index. These had small changes made to their names (if they use upper-\/ or lowercase letters) a long time ago. (for better or for worse, but I want to avoid changing the names now again to avoid breaking peoples\textquotesingle{} code)
\item Grid\+Node.\+Get\+Index.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed the Node class which has been marked as obsolete a very long time. This class has been renamed to Graph\+Node to avoid name conflicts.
\item Removed Local\+Avoidance\+Mover which has been marked as obsolete a very long time. The R\+VO system has replaced it.
\item Removed Seeker.\+Modifier\+Pass.\+Post\+Process\+Original since it was not used. This also caused Seeker.\+post\+Process\+Original\+Path to be removed.
\item Removed support for A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+M\+O\+R\+E\+\_\+\+P\+A\+T\+H\+\_\+\+I\+DS because it wasn\textquotesingle{}t really useful, it only increased the memory usage.
\item Removed Path.\+height, radius, turn\+Radius, walkability\+Mask and speed since they were dummy variables that have not been used and are better implemented using inheritance anyway. This is also done to reduce confusion for users.
\item Removed the old local avoidance system which has long since been marked as obsolete and replaced by the R\+VO based system.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+6.\+7 (2015-\/06-\/08)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a race condition when On\+Path\+Pre\+Search and On\+Path\+Post\+Search were called. When the Alternative\+Path modifier was used, this could cause the pathfinding threads to crash with a null reference exception.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+6.\+6 (2015-\/05-\/27)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improvements
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Point Graphs are now supported when using A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+N\+O\+\_\+\+J\+S\+ON.
\item The Optimizations tab now modifies the player settings instead of changing the source files. This is more stable and your settings are now preserved even when you upgrade the system.
\item The Optimizations tab now works regardless of the directory you have installed the package in. Hopefully the whole project is now directory agnostic, but you never know.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Switched out On\+Void\+Delegate for System.\+Action. You might get a compiler error because of this (for the few that use it) but then just rename your delegate to System.\+Action.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed recast graphs not saving all fields when using A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+N\+O\+\_\+\+J\+S\+ON.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+6.\+5 (2015-\/05-\/19)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed recast graphs generating odd navmeshes on non-\/square terrains.
\item Fixed serialization sometimes failing with the error \textquotesingle{}Argument cannot be null\textquotesingle{} when A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+N\+O\+\_\+\+J\+S\+ON was enabled.
\item The \textquotesingle{}Walkable Climb\textquotesingle{} setting on recast graphs is now clamped to be at most equal to \textquotesingle{}Walkable Height\textquotesingle{} because otherwise the navmesh generation can fail in some rare cases.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Recast graphs now show unwalkable nodes with a red outline instead of their normal colors.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+6.\+4 (2015-\/04-\/19)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved compatibility with W\+I\+IU and other big-\/endian platforms.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+6.\+3 (2015-\/04-\/19)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed R\+V\+O\+Navmesh not adding obstacles correctly (they were added added, but all agents ignored them).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+6.\+2 (2015-\/04-\/14)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed null reference exception in the Point\+Graph On\+Draw\+Gizmos method.
\item Fixed a few example scene errors in Unity 5.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+6.\+1 (2015-\/04-\/06)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Upgrade notes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The behaviour of Nav\+Graph.\+Relocate\+Nodes has changed. The old\+Matrix was previously treated as the new\+Matrix and vice versa so you might need to switch the order of your parameters if you are calling it.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Highlights\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Works in Web\+G\+L/\+I\+L2\+C\+PP (Unity 5.\+0.\+0p3). At least according to my limited tests.
\item Implemented Relocate\+Nodes for recast graphs (however it cannot be used on tiled recast graphs).
\item Added support for hexagon graphs. Enable it by changing the \textquotesingle{}Connections\textquotesingle{} field on a grid graph to \textquotesingle{}Six\textquotesingle{}.
\item Fixed Astar\+Data.\+Deserialize\+Graphs\+Additive (thanks tmcsweeney).
\item Fixed pathfinding threads sometimes not terminating correctly. This would show up as a \textquotesingle{}Could not terminate pathfinding thread...\textquotesingle{} error message.
\item Added a version of Grid\+Graph.\+Relocate\+Nodes which takes grid settings instead of a matrix for ease of use.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed Nav\+Graph.\+Safe\+On\+Destroy
\item Removed Grid\+Graph.\+scans because it is a pretty useless variable.
\item Removed Nav\+Graph.\+Create\+Nodes (and overriden methods) since they were not used.
\item Made Grid\+Graph.\+Remove\+Grid\+Graph\+From\+Static private.
\item Removed Nav\+Mesh\+Graph.\+Deserialize\+Mesh\+Nodes since it was not used.
\item Made Seeker.\+last\+Completed\+Vector\+Path, last\+Completed\+Node\+Path, On\+Path\+Complete, On\+Multi\+Path\+Complete, On\+Partial\+Path\+Complete private since they really shouldn\textquotesingle{}t be used by other scripts.
\item Removed Seeker.\+save\+Get\+Nearest\+Hints, Seeker.\+start\+Hint, Seeker.\+end\+Hint, Seeker.\+Delay\+Path\+Start since they were not used.
\item Removed unused methods of little use\+: Astar\+Data.\+Guid\+To\+Index and Astar\+Data.\+Guid\+To\+Graph.
\item Removed Recast\+Graph.\+vertices and Recast\+Graph.\+vector\+Vertices since they were obsolete and not used.
\item Removed some old Unity 4.\+3 and Unity 3 compatibility code.
\item Recast graphs\textquotesingle{} \textquotesingle{}Snap to scene\textquotesingle{} button now takes into account the layer mask and the tag mask when snapping, it now also checks terrains and colliders instead of just meshes (thanks Kieran).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed Recast\+Graph bounds gizmos could sometimes be drawn with the wrong color.
\item Fixed a rare data race which would cause an exception with the message \textquotesingle{}Trying to initialize a node when it is not safe to initialize any nodes\textquotesingle{} to be thrown
\item Tweaked Undo behaviour, should be more stable now.
\item Fixed grid graph editor changing the center field very little every frame (floating point errors) causing an excessive amount of undo items to be created.
\item Reduced unecessary dirtying of the scene (thanks Ben Hymers).
\item Fixed R\+V\+O\+Core\+Simulator.\+Wall\+Thickness (thanks tmcsweeney).
\item Fixed recast graph not properly checking for the case where an object had a Mesh\+Filter but no Renderer (thanks 3rin\+Jax).
\item Fixed disabling A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+R\+E\+C\+A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+A\+R\+R\+A\+Y\+\_\+\+B\+A\+S\+E\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+N\+K\+E\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+ST (now A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+R\+E\+C\+A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+C\+L\+A\+S\+S\+\_\+\+B\+A\+S\+E\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+N\+K\+E\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+ST) would cause compiler errors.
\item Fixed recast graphs could sometimes voxelize the world incorrectly and the resulting navmesh would have artifacts.
\item Fixed graph\+Mask code having been removed from the free version in some cases due to old code which treated it as a pro only feature.
\item Improved compatibility with Xbox One.
\item Fixed R\+V\+O\+Controller layer field not working when multiple agents were selected.
\item Fixed grid nodes not being able to have custom connections in the free version.
\item Fixed runtime error on P\+S4.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+6 (2015-\/02-\/02)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Upgrade notes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Cache data for faster startup is now stored in a separate file.~\newline
 This reduces the huge lag some users have been experiencing since Unity changed their Undo system.~\newline
 You will need to open the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path}{Astar\+Path}} components which used cached startup, go to the save and load tab and press a button labeled \char`\"{}\+Transfer cache data to a separate file\char`\"{}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Highlights\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for the Jump Point Search algorithm on grid graphs (pro only).~\newline
 The J\+PS algorithm can be used to speed up pathfinding on grid graphs {\itshape without any penalties or tag weights applied} (it only works on uniformly weighted graphs). It can be several times faster than normal A$\ast$. It works best on open areas.
\item Added support for heuristic optimizations (pro only).~\newline
 This can be applied on any static graph, i.\+e any graph which does not change. It requires a rather slow preprocessing step so graph updates will be really slow when using this. However when the preprocessing is done, it can speed up pathfinding with an order of magnitude. It works especially well in mazes with lots of options and dead ends.~\newline
 Combined with J\+PS (mentioned above) I have seen it perform up to 20x better than regular A$\ast$ with no heuristic optimizations.
\item Added Point\+Node.\+game\+Object which will contain the Game\+Object each node was created from.
\item Added support for R\+VO obstacles.~\newline
 It is by no means perfect at this point, but at least it works.
\item Undo works reasonably well again.~\newline
 It took a lot of time working around weird Unity behaviours. For example Unity seems to send undo events when dragging items to object fields (why? no idea).
\item Dragging meshes to the Navmesh\+Graph.\+Source\+Mesh field works again.~\newline
 See fix about undo above.
\item Extended the max number of possible areas (connected components) to 2$^\wedge$17 = 131072 up from 2$^\wedge$10 = 1024.~\newline
 No memory usage increase, just shuffling bits around.~\newline
 Deprecated compiler directive A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+M\+O\+R\+E\+\_\+\+A\+R\+E\+AS
\item Extended the max number of graphs in the inspector to 256 up from 4 or 32 depending on settings.~\newline
 No memory usage increase, just shuffling bits around. I still don\textquotesingle{}t recommend that you actually use this many graphs.
\item Added Recast\+Tile\+Update and Recast\+Tile\+Update\+Handler scripts for easier recast tile updating with good performance.
\item When using A$\ast$ Inspector -\/$>$ Settings -\/$>$ Debug -\/$>$ Path Debug Mode = \{G,F,H,Penalties\} you previously had to set the limits for what should be displayed as \char`\"{}red\char`\"{} in the scene view yourself, this is now optionally automatically calculated. The UI for it has also been improved.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Improvements\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added penalty\+Angle\+Power to Grid Graph -\/$>$ Extra -\/$>$ Penalty from Angle.~\newline
 This can be used to increase the penalty even more for large angles than for small angles (more than it already does, that is).
\item A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+N\+O\+\_\+\+J\+S\+ON now works for recast graphs as well.
\item Added custom inspector for Recast\+Mesh\+Obj, hopefully it will not be as confusing anymore.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Flee\+Path now has a default flee strength of 1 to avoid confusion when the Flee\+Path doesn\textquotesingle{}t seem to flee from anything.
\item Removed some irrelevant defines from the Optimizations tab.
\item I\+Agent.\+Position cannot be changed anymore, instead use the Teleport and Set\+Y\+Position methods.
\item Exposed Graph\+Update\+Object.\+changed\+Nodes.
\item Deprecated the thread\+Safe paremeter on Register\+Safe\+Update, it is always treated as true now.
\item The default value for Astar\+Path.\+min\+Area\+Size is now 0 since the number of areas (connected component) indices has been greatly increased (see highlights).
\item Tweaked Procedural\+World script (used for the \char`\"{}\+Procedural\char`\"{} example scene) to reduce F\+PS drops.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_af1c57d0189ace1df1057118032c47223}{Astar\+Path.\+Flush\+Graph\+Updates}} will now complete all graph updates instead of just making sure they have started.~\newline
 In addition to avoiding confusion, this fixes a rare null reference exception which could happen when using the Graph\+Update\+Utilities.\+Update\+Graphs\+No\+Block method.
\item Fixed some cases where updating recast graphs could throw exceptions. (message begun with \char`\"{}\+No Voxelizer object. Update\+Area\+Init...\char`\"{})
\item Fixed typo in R\+V\+O\+Simulator. desired\+Simulaton\+F\+PS -\/$>$ desired\+Simulation\+F\+PS.
\item R\+VO agents move smoother now (previously their velocity could change widely depending on the fps, the average velocity was correct however)
\item Fixed an exception which could, with some graph settings, be thrown when deserializing on i\+Phone when bytecode stripping was enabled.
\item Fixed a Null\+Reference\+Exception in Multi\+Target\+Path which was thrown if the path debug mode was set to \char`\"{}\+Heavy\char`\"{}.
\item Fixed Path\+Utilies.\+B\+FS always returning zero nodes (thanks Ajveach).
\item Made reverting Graph\+Update\+Objects work. The Graph\+Update\+Utilities.\+Update\+Graphs\+No\+Block was also fixed by this change.
\item Fixed compile error with monodevelop.
\item Fixed a bug which caused scanning to fail if more than one Navmesh\+Graph existed.
\item Fixed the lightweight local avoidance example scene which didn\textquotesingle{}t work previously.
\item Fixed Simple\+Smooth\+Modifier not exposing Roundness Factor in the editor for the Curved Nonuniform mode.
\item Fixed an exception when updating Recast\+Graphs and using Relevant\+Graph\+Surfaces and multithreading.
\item Fixed exceptions caused by starting paths from other threads than the Unity thread.
\item Fixed an infinite loop/out of memory exception that could occur sometimes when graph updates were being done at the start of the game (I hate multithreading race conditions).
\item Fixed the Optimizations tab not working when JS Support was enabled.
\item Fixed graph updating not working on navmesh graphs (it was broken before due to a missing line of code).
\item Fixed some misspelled words in the documentation.
\item Removed some unused and/or redundant variables.
\item Fixed a case where graphs added using code might not always be configured correctly (and would throw exceptions when scanning).
\item Improved Windows Store compatibility.
\item Fixed a typo in the Grid\+Graph which could cause compilation to fail when building for Windows Phone or Windows Store (thanks MariuszP)
\item Lots of code cleanups and comments added to various scripts.
\item Fixed some cases where Mono\+Develop would pick up the wrong documention for fields since it doesn\textquotesingle{}t support all features that Doxygen supports.
\item Fixed a bug which caused the points field on Graph\+Update\+Scene to sometimes not be editable.
\item Fixed a bug which could cause R\+VO agents not to move if the fps was low and Interpolation and Double Buffering was used.
\item Set the execution order for R\+V\+O\+Controller and R\+V\+O\+Simulator to make sure that other scripts will get the latest position in their Update method.
\item Fixed a bug which could cause some nearest point on line methods in Astar\+Math to return NaN. This could happen when Seeker-\/$>$Start End Modifier-\/$>$Start\+Point and End\+Point was set to Interpolate.
\item Fixed a runtime error on PS Vita.
\item Fixed an index out of range exception which could occur when scanning Layered\+Grid\+Graphs.
\item Fixed an index out of range exception which could occur when drawing gizmos for a Layered\+Grid\+Graph.
\item Fixed a bug which could cause Produral\+Grid\+Mover to update the graph every frame regardless of if the target moved or not (thanks Makak for finding the bug).
\item Fixed a number of warnings in Unity 5.

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+5.\+2 (2013-\/09-\/01) (tiny bugfix and small feature release)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added isometric angle option for grid graphs to help with isometric 2D games.
\item Fixed a bug with the R\+V\+O\+Agent class which caused the Lightweight\+R\+VO example scene to not work as intended (no agents were avoiding each other).
\item Fixed some documentation typos.
\item Fixed some compilations errors some people were having with other compilers than Unity\textquotesingle{}s.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+5.\+1 (2014-\/06-\/15)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added avoidance masks to local avoidance. Each agent now has a layer and each agent can specify which layers it will avoid.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+5 (2014-\/06-\/12)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added back local avoidance!! The new system uses a sampling based algorithm instead of a geometric one. The A\+PI is almost exactly the same so if you used the previous system this will be a drop in replacement. As for performance, it is roughly the same, maybe slightly worse in high density situations and slightly better in less dense situations. It can handle several thousand agents on an i7 processor. Obstacles are not yet supported, but they will be added in a future update.
\item Binary heap switched out for a 4-\/ary heap. This improves pathfinding performances by about 5\%.
\item Optimized scanning of navmesh graphs (not the recast graphs) Large meshes should be much faster to scan now.
\item Optimized B\+B\+Tree (nearest node lookup for navmesh/recast graphs, pro version only) Nearest node queries on navmesh/recast graphs should be slightly faster now.
\item Minor updates to the documentation, esp. to the Graph\+Node class.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+4.\+0.\+7
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item Added Path\+Utilities.\+B\+FS.
\item Added Path\+Utilities.\+Get\+Points\+Around\+Point\+World.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+4.\+0.\+5
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added offline documentation (Documentation.\+zip)
\item Misc fixes for namespace conflicts people have been having. This should improve compatibility with other packages. You might need to delete the Astar\+Pathfinding\+Project folder and reimport the package for everything to work.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+4.\+0.\+4
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed R\+V\+O\+Simulator\+Editor from the free version, it was causing compiler errors.
\item Made Point\+Graph.\+nodes public.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+4.\+0.\+3
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed Local Avoidance due to licensing issues. Agents will fall back to not avoiding each other. I am working to get the local avoidance back as soon as possible.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+4.\+0.\+2
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Unity Asset Store forced me to increase version number.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+4.\+0.\+1
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed an Array\+Index\+Out\+Of\+Bounds exception which could be thrown by the Procedural\+Grid\+Mover script in the Procedural example scene if the target was moved too quickly.
\item The project no longer references assets from the Standard Assets folder (the package on the Unity Asset Store did so by mistake before).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+4
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a null reference exception when scanning recast graphs and rasterizing colliders.
\item Removed duplicate clipper\+\_\+library.\+dll which was causing compiler errors.
\item Support for 2D Physics collision testing when using Grid Graphs.
\item Better warnings when using odd settings for Grid Graphs.
\item Minor cleanups.
\item Queued graph updates are no longer being performed when the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path}{Astar\+Path}} object is destroyed, this just took time.
\item Fixed a bug introduced in 3.\+3.\+11 which forced grid graphs to be square in Unity versions earlier than 4.\+3.
\item Fixed a null reference in B\+B\+Tree ( used by Recast\+Graph).
\item Fixed Navmesh\+Graph not rebuilding B\+B\+Tree on cached start (causing performance issues on larger graphs).
\item Includes all changes from the beta releases below
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Beta 3.\+3.\+14 ( available for everyone! )
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All dlls are now in namespaces (e.\+g Pathfinding.\+Ionic.\+Zip instead of just Ionic.\+Zip ) to avoid conflicts with other packages.
\item Most scripts are now in namespaces to avoid conflicts with other packages.
\item Grid\+Nodes now support custom connections.
\item Cleanups, preparing for release.
\item Reverted to using an Int3 for Graph\+Node.\+position instead of an abstract Position property, the tiny memory gains were not worth it.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Beta 3.\+3.\+13 ( 4.\+3 compatible only )
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed an issue where deleting a Navmesh\+Cut component would not update the underlaying graph.
\item Better update checking.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Beta 3.\+3.\+12 ( 4.\+3 compatible only )
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed an infinite loop which could happen when scanning graphs during runtime ( not the first scan ).
\item Node\+Link component is now working correctly.
\item Added options for optimizations to the Point\+Graph.
\item Improved Tile\+Handler and navmesh cutting.
\item Fixed rare bug which could mess up navmeshes when using navmesh cutting.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Beta 3.\+3.\+11 ( 4.\+3 compatible only )
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed update checking. A bug has caused update checking not to run unless you had been running a previous version in which the bug did not exist. I am not sure how long this bug has been here, but potentially for a very long time.
\item Added an update notification window which pops up when there is a new version of the A$\ast$ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} Project.
\item Lots of UI fixes for Unity 4.\+3
\item Lots of other UI fixes and imprements.
\item Fixed gravity for Rich\+AI.
\item Fixed Undo for Unity 4.\+3
\item Added a new example scene showing a procedural environment.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Beta 3.\+3.\+10
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed Recast\+Graph.\+include\+Out\+Of\+Bounds.
\item Fixed a few bugs when updating Layered Grid Graphs causing incorrect connections to be created, and valid ones to be left out.
\item Fixed a null reference bug when removing R\+VO agents.
\item Fixed memory leaks when deserializing graphs or reloading scenes.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Beta 3.\+3.\+9
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added new tutorial page about recast graphs.
\item Recast Graph\+: Fixed a bug which could cause vertical surfaces to be ignored.
\item Removed support for C++ Recast.
\item Fixed rare bug which could mess up navmeshes when using navmesh cutting.
\item Improved Tile\+Handler and navmesh cutting.
\item Graph\+Modifiers now take O(n) (linear) time to destroy at end of game instead of O(n$^\wedge$2) (quadratic).
\item Recast\+Graph now has a toggle for using tiles or not.
\item Added Relevant\+Graph\+Surface which can be used with Recast\+Graphs to prune away non-\/relevant surfaces.
\item Removed Recast\+Graph.\+accurate\+Nearest\+Node since it was not used anymore.
\item Added Recast\+Graph.\+nearest\+Search\+Only\+XZ.
\item Recast\+Graph now has support for removing small areas.
\item Added toggle to show or hide connections between nodes on a recast graph.
\item Point\+Node has some graph searching methods overloaded specially. This increases performance and reduces alloacations when searching point graphs.
\item Reduced allocations when searching on Recast\+Graph.
\item Reduced allocations in Rich\+AI and Rich\+Path. Everything is pooled now, so for most requests no allocations will be done.
\item Reduced allocations in general by using \char`\"{}yield return null\char`\"{} instead of \char`\"{}yield return 0\char`\"{}
\item Fixed teleport for local avoidance agents. Previously moving an agent from one position to another could cause it to interpolate between those two positions for a brief amount of time instead of staying at the second position.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Beta 3.\+3.\+8
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Nicer Rich\+AI gizmo colors.
\item Fixed Rich\+AI not using raycast when no path has been calculated.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Beta 3.\+3.\+7
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item Added gizmos to Rich\+AI
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Beta 3.\+3.\+6
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed node positions being off by half a node size. Get\+Nearest node queries on grid graphs would be slightly inexact.
\item Fixed grid graph updating could get messed up when using erosion.
\item ... among other things, see below
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Beta 3.\+3.\+5 and 3.\+3.\+6
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Highlights
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rewritten graph nodes. Nodes can now be created more easily (less overhead when creating nodes).
\item Graphs may use their custom optimized memory structure for storing nodes.
\item Performance improvements for scanning recast graphs.
\item Added a whole new AI script. Rich\+AI (and the class Rich\+Path for some things)\+: This script is intended for navmesh based graphs and has features such as\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Guarantees that the character stays on the navmesh
\item Minor deviations from the path can be fixed without a path recalculation.
\item Very exact stop at endpoint (seriously, precision with something like 7 decimals). No more circling around the target point as with A\+I\+Path.
\item Does not use path modifiers at all (for good reasons). It has an internal funnel modifier however.
\item Simple wall avoidance to avoid too much wall hugging.
\item Basic support for off-\/mesh links (see example scene).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved randomness for Random\+Path and Flee\+Path, all nodes considered now have an equal chance of being selected.
\item Recast now has support for tiles. This enabled much larger worlds to be rasterized (without Out\+Of\+Memory errors) and allows for dynamic graph updates. Still slow, but much faster than a complete recalculation of the graph.
\item Navmesh Cutting can now be done on recast graphs. This is a kind of (relatively) cheap graph updating which punches a hole in the navmesh to make place for obstacles. So it only supports removing geometry, not adding it (like bridges). This update is comparitively fast, and it makes real time navmesh updating possible. See video\+: \href{http://youtu.be/qXi5qhhGNIw}{\texttt{ http\+://youtu.\+be/q\+Xi5qhh\+G\+N\+Iw}}.
\item Added Recast\+Mesh\+Obj which can be attached to any Game\+Object to include that object in recast rasterization. It exposes more options and is also faster for graph updates with logarithmic lookup complexity instead of linear (good for larger worlds when doing graph updating).
\item Reintroducing special connection costs for start and end nodes. Before multithreading was introduced, pathfinding on navmesh graphs could recalculate the connection costs for the start and end nodes to take into account that the start point is not actually exactly at the start node\textquotesingle{}s position (triangles are usually quite a larger than the player/npc/whatever). This didn\textquotesingle{}t work with multithreading however and could mess up pathfinding, so it was removed. Now it has been reintroduced, working with multithreading! This means more accurate paths on navmeshes.
\item Added several methods to pick random points (e.\+g for group movement) to Pathfinding.\+Path\+Utlitilies.
\item Added Radius\+Modifier. A new modifier which can offset the path based on the character radius. Intended for navmesh graphs which are not shrinked by the character radius at start but can be used for other purposes as well.
\item Improved Graph\+Update\+Scene gizmos. Convex gizmos are now correctly placed. It also shows a bounding box when selected (not showing this has confused a lot of people).
\item A\+I\+Path has gotten some cleanups. Among other things it now behaves correctly when disabled and then enabled again making it easy to pool and reuse (should that need arise).
\item Funnel modifier on grid graphs will create wider funnels for diagonals which results in nicer paths.
\item If an exception is thrown during pathfinding, the program does no longer hang at quit.
\item Split Automatic thread count into Automatic High Load and Automatic Low Load. The former one using a higher number of thread.
\item Thread count used is now shown in the editor.
\item Grid\+Graph now supports Closest\+On\+Node (Start\+End\+Modifier) properly. Snap\+To\+Node gives the previous behaviour on Grid\+Graphs (they were identical before).
\item New example scene Door2 which uses the Navmesh\+Cut component.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed spelling error in Grid\+Graph.\+uniform\+Width\+Depth\+Grid.
\item Erosion radius (character radius, recast graphs) could become half of what it really should be in many cases.
\item Recast\+Graph will not rasterize triggers.
\item Fixed recast not being able to handle multiple terrains.
\item Fixed recast generating an incorrect mesh for terrains in some cases (not the whole terrain was included).
\item Linecast on many graph types had incorrect descriptions saying that the function returns true when the line does not intersect any obstacles, it is actually the other way around. Descriptions corrected.
\item The list of nodes returned by a Constant\+Path is now guaranteed to have no duplicates.
\item Many recast constants are now proper constants instead of static variables.
\item Fixed bug in Grid\+Node.\+Remove\+Grid\+Graph which caused graphs not being cleaned up correctly. Could cause problems later on.
\item Fixed an Argument\+Out\+Of\+Range exception in List\+Pool class.
\item Relocate\+Nodes on Nav\+Mesh\+Graph now correctly recalculates connection costs and rebuilds the internal query tree (thanks peted on the forums).
\item Much better member documentation for R\+V\+O\+Controller.
\item Exposed Max\+Neighbours from I\+Agent to R\+V\+O\+Controller.
\item Fixed Astar\+Data.\+Update\+Shortcuts not being called when caching was enabled. This caused graph shortcuts such as Astar\+Path.\+astar\+Data.\+grid\+Graph not being set when loaded from a cache.
\item R\+V\+O\+Core\+Simulator/\+R\+V\+O\+Simulator now cleans up the worker threads correctly.
\item Tiled recast graphs can now be serialized.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Renamed Modifier class to Path\+Modifier to avoid naming conflicts with user scripts and other packages.
\item Cleaned up recast, put inside namespace and split into multiple files.
\item List\+Pool and friends are now threadsafe.
\item Removed Polygon.\+Dot since the Vector3 class already contains such a method.
\item The Scan functions now use callbacks for progress info instead of I\+Enumerators. Graphs can now output progress info as well.
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_nav_graph_a8a16a2a7653e1420cf4863371782b7e9}{Pathfinding.\+Nav\+Graph.\+Count\+Nodes}} function.
\item Removed Graph\+Hit\+Info.\+success field since it was not used.
\item Graph\+Update\+Scene will now fall back to collider.\+bounds or renderer.\+bounds (depending on what is available) if no points are defined for the shape.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_aff2addb8d4dcda803cbdcffbdd94c833}{Astar\+Path.\+Start\+Path}} now has an option to put the path in the front of the queue to prioritize its calculation over other paths.
\item Time.\+fixed\+Delta\+Time by Time.\+delta\+Time in A\+I\+Path.\+Rotate\+Towards() to work with both Fixed\+Update and Update. (Thanks Pat\+\_\+\+After\+Moon) You might have to configure the turn speed variable after updating since the actual rotation speed might have changed a bit depending on your settings.
\item Fixed max\+Neighbour\+Distance not being used correctly by the R\+V\+O\+Controller script. It would stay at the default value. If you have had trouble getting local avoidance working on world with a large scale, this could have been the problem. (Thanks to Edgar Sun for providing a reproducible example case)
\item Graphs loaded using Deserialize\+Graphs\+Additive will get their graph\+Index variables on the nodes set to the correct values. (thanks peted for noticing the bug).
\item Fixed a null reference exception in Multi\+Target\+Path (thanks Dave for informing me about the bug).
\item Graph\+Update\+Scene.\+use\+World\+Space is now false per default.
\item If no log output is disabled and we are not running in the editor, log output will be discarded as early as possible for performance. Even though in theory log output could be enabled between writing to internal log strings and deciding if log output should be written.
\item Nav\+Graph.\+inverse\+Matrix is now a field, not a property (for performance). All writes to matrix should be through the Set\+Matrix method.
\item Start\+End\+Modifier now uses Closest\+On\+Node for both start\+Point and end\+Point by default.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Known bugs
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Linecasting on graphs is broken at the moment. (working for recast/navmesh graph atm. Except in very special cases)
\item R\+V\+O\+Navmesh does not work with tiled recast graphs.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+2.\+5.\+1
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Pooling of paths had been accidentally disabled in A\+I\+Path.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+2.\+5
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for serializing dictionaries with integer keys via a Json Converter.
\item If draw\+Gizmos is disabled on the seeker, paths will be recycled instantly. This will show up so that if you had a seeker with draw\+Gizmos=false, and then enable draw\+Gizmos, it will not draw gizmos until the next path request is issued.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed U\+N\+I\+T\+Y\+\_\+4\+\_\+0 preprocesor directives which were indented for U\+N\+I\+TY 4 and not only 4.\+0. Now they will be enabled for all 4.\+x versions of unity instead of only 4.\+0.
\item Fixed a path pool leak in the Seeker which could cause paths not to be released if a seeker was destroyed.
\item When using a non-\/positive max\+Distance for point graphs less processing power will be used.
\item Removed unused \textquotesingle{}recycle\+Paths\textquotesingle{} variable in the A\+I\+Path class.
\item Null\+Reference\+Exception could occur if the Pathfinding.\+Node.\+connections array was null.
\item Fixed Null\+Reference\+Exception which could occur sometimes when using a Multi\+Target\+Path (Issue 16)
\item Changed Ctrl to Alt when recalcing path continously in the Path Types example scene to avoid clearing the points for the Multi\+Target\+Path at the same time (it was also using Ctrl).
\item Fixed strange looking movement artifacts during the first few frames when using R\+VO and interpolation was enabled.
\item Alternative\+Path modifier will no longer cause underflows if penalties have been reset during the time it was active. It will now only log a warning message and zero the penalty.
\item Added \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_graph_update_object_a7462e9e4ec8d6831c65213306cd41baa}{Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Update\+Object.\+reset\+Penalty\+On\+Physics}} (and similar in Graph\+Update\+Scene) to force grid graphs not to reset penalties when updating graphs.
\item Fixed a bug which could cause pathfinding to crash if using the preprocessor directive A\+S\+T\+A\+R\+\_\+\+No\+Tag\+Penalty.
\item Fixed a case where Start\+End\+Modifier.\+exact\+End\+Point would incorrectly be used instead of exact\+Start\+Point.
\item Alternative\+Path modifier now correctly resets penalties if it is destroyed.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+2.\+4.\+1
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Unity Asset Store guys complained about the wrong key image. I had to update the version number to submit again.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+2.\+4
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Highlights
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Recast\+Graph can now rasterize colliders as well!
\item Recast\+Graph can rasterize colliders added to trees on unity terrains!
\item Recast\+Graph will use Graphics.\+Draw\+Mesh\+Now functions in Unity 4 instead of creating a dummy Game\+Object. This will remove the annoying \char`\"{}cleaning up leaked mesh object\char`\"{} debug message which unity would log sometimes. The debug mesh is now also only visible in the Scene View when the A$\ast$ object is selected as that seemed most logical to me (don\textquotesingle{}t like this? post something in the forum saying you want a toggle for it and I will implement one).
\item Graph\+Update\+Object now has a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_graph_update_object_a3bdfb340802e0f334777ff6e29c7aeba}{toggle }} specifying if erosion (on grid graphs) should be recalculated after applying the guo. This enables one to add walkable nodes which should have been made unwalkable by erosion.
\item Made it a bit easier (and added more correct documentation) to add custom graph types when building for i\+Phone with Fast But No Exceptions (see i\+Phone page).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Recast\+Graph now only rasterizes enabled Mesh\+Renderers. Previously even disabled ones would be included.
\item Renamed Recast\+Graph.\+include\+Terrain to Recast\+Graph.\+rasterize\+Terrain to better match other variable naming.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A\+I\+Path now resumes path calculation when the component or Game\+Object has been disabled and then reenabled.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+2.\+3 (free version mostly)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A U\+N\+I\+T\+Y\+\_\+\+I\+P\+H\+O\+NE directive was not included in the free version. This caused compilation errors when building for i\+Phone.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Some documentation updates
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+2.\+2
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Max Slope in grid graphs is now relative to the graph\textquotesingle{}s up direction instead of world up (makes more sense I hope)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Note
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Update really too small to be an update by itself, but I was updating the build scripts I use for the project and had to upload a new version because of technical reasons.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+2.\+1
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed bug which caused compiler errors on build (player, not in editor).
\item Version number was by mistake set to 3.\+1 instead of 3.\+2 in the previous version.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+2
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Highlights
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A complete Local Avoidance system is now included in the pro version!
\item Almost every allocation can now be pooled. Which means a drastically lower allocation rate (GC get\textquotesingle{}s called less often).
\item Initial node penalty per graph can now be set. Custom graph types implementing Create\+Nodes must update their implementations to properly assign this value.
\item Graph\+Update\+Scene has now many more tools and options which can be used.
\item Added Pathfinding.\+Path\+Utilities which contains some usefull functions for working with paths and nodes.
\item Added Pathfinding.\+Node.\+Get\+Connections to enable easy getting of all connections of a node. The Node.\+connections array does not include custom connections which for example grid graphs use.
\item Seeker.\+Post\+Process function was added for easy postprocessing of paths calculated without a seeker.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_ac46f3c7ee27f7e587a00f549a9a7118d}{Astar\+Path.\+Wait\+For\+Path}}. Wait (block) until a specific path has been calculated.
\item Path.\+Wait\+For\+Path. Wait using a coroutine until a specific path has been calculated.
\item Layered\+Grid\+Graph now has support for up to 65535 layers (theoretically, but don\textquotesingle{}t try it as you would probably run out of memory)
\item Recast graph generation is now up to twice as fast!
\item Fixed some UI glitches in Unity 4.
\item Debugger component has more features and a slightly better layout.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a bug which caused the Simple\+Smooth\+Modifier with uniform\+Segment\+Length enabled to skip points sometimes.
\item Fixed a bug where importing graphs additively which had the same G\+U\+ID as a graph already loaded could cause bugs in the inspector.
\item Fixed a bug where updating a Grid\+Graph loaded from file would throw a Null\+Reference\+Exception.
\item Fixed a bug which could cause error messages for paths not to be logged
\item Fixed a number of small bugs related to updating grid graphs (especially when using erosion as well).
\item Overflows could occur in some navmesh/polygon math related functions when working with Int3s. This was because the precision of them had recently been increased. Further down the line this could cause incorrect answers to Get\+Nearest queries. Fixed by casting to long when necessary.
\item Navmesh2.\+shader defined \char`\"{}\+Cull Off\char`\"{} twice.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} threads are now background threads. This will prevent them from blocking the process to terminate if they of some reason are still alive (hopefully at least).
\item When really high penalties are applied (which could be underflowed negative penalties) a warning message is logged. Really high penalties (close to max uint value) can otherwise cause overflows and in some cases infinity loops because of that.
\item Closest\+Point\+On\+Triangle is now spelled correctly.
\item Mine\+Bot\+AI now uses Update instead of Fixed\+Update.
\item Use Dark Skin option is now exposed again since it could be incorrectly set sometimes. Now you can force it to light or dark, or set it to auto.
\item Fixed recast graph bug when using multiple terrains. Previously only one terrain would be used.
\item Fixed some UI glitches in Unity 4.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed Pathfinding.\+N\+N\+Info.\+priority.
\item Removed Pathfinding.\+Nearest\+Node\+Priority.
\item Conversions between N\+N\+Info and Node are now explicit to comply with the rule of \char`\"{}if information might be lost\+: use explicit casts\char`\"{}.
\item N\+N\+Info is now a struct.
\item Graph\+Hit\+Info is now a struct.
\item Path.\+vector\+Path and Path.\+path are now List$<$\+Vector3$>$ and List$<$\+Node$>$ respectively. This is done to enable pooling of resources more efficiently.
\item Added Pathfinding.\+Node.\+Recalculate\+Connection\+Costs.
\item Moved Is\+Path\+Possible from Graph\+Update\+Utilities to Path\+Utilities.
\item Pathfinding.\+Path.\+processed was replaced with Pathfinding.\+Path.\+state. The new variable will have much more information about where the path is in the pathfinding pipeline.
\item {\bfseries{Paths should not be created with constructors anymore, instead use the Path\+Pool class and then call some Setup() method}}
\item When the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path}{Astar\+Path}} object is destroyed, calculated paths in the return queue are not returned with errors anymore, but just returned.
\item Removed depracated methods Astar\+Path.\+Add\+To\+Path\+Pool, Recycle\+Path, Get\+From\+Path\+Pool.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Bugs
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C++ Version of Recast does not work on Windows.
\item Graph\+Update\+Scene does in some cases not draw correctly positioned gizmos.
\item Starting two webplayers and closing down the first might cause the other one\textquotesingle{}s pathfinding threads to crash (unity bug?) (confirmed on osx)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+1.\+4 (i\+OS fixes)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item More fixes for the i\+OS platform.
\item The \char`\"{}\+Json\+Fx.\+Json.\+dll\char`\"{} file is now correctly named.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed unused code from Dot\+Net\+Zip which reduced the size of it with about 20 KB.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+1.\+3 (free version only)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Some of the fixes which were said to have been made in 3.\+1.\+2 were actually not included in the free version of the project. Sorry about that.
\item Also includes a new Json\+Fx and Ionic.\+Zip dll. This should make it possible to build with the .Net 2.\+0 Subset again see\+: \href{http://www.arongranberg.com/forums/topic/ios-problem/page/1/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+arongranberg.\+com/forums/topic/ios-\/problem/page/1/}}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+1.\+2 (small bugfix release)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a bug which caused builds for i\+Phone to fail.
\item Fixed a bug which caused runtime errors on the i\+Phone platform.
\item Fixed a bug which caused huge lag in the editor for some users when using grid graphs.
\item List\+Graphs are now correctly loaded as Point\+Graphs when loading data from older versions of the system.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Moved Json\+Fx into the namespace Pathfinding.\+Serialization.\+Json\+Fx to avoid conflicts with users own Json\+Fx libraries (if they used Json\+Fx).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Known bugs
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Recast graph does not work when using static batching on any objects included.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+1.\+1 (small bugfix release)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a bug which would cause Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Update\+Utilities.\+Update\+Graphs\+No\+Block to throw an exception when using multithreading
\item Fixed a bug which caused an error to be logged and no pathfinding working when not using multithreading in the free version of the project
\item Fixed some example scene bugs due to downgrading the project from Unity 3.\+5 to Unity 3.\+4
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+1
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed bug which caused Layer\+Mask fields (Grid\+Graph inspector for example) to behave weirdly for custom layers on Unity 3.\+5 and up.
\item The color setting \char`\"{}\+Node Connection\char`\"{} now actually sets the colors of the node connections when no other information should be shown using the connection colors or when no data is available.
\item Put the Int3 class in a separate file.
\item Casting between Int3 and Vector3 is no longer implicit. This follows the rule of \char`\"{}if information might be lost\+: use explicit casts\char`\"{}.
\item Renamed List\+Graph to Point\+Graph. \char`\"{}\+List\+Graph\char`\"{} has previously been used for historical reasons. Point\+Graph is a more suitable name.
\item Graph can now have names in the editor (just click the name in the graph list)
\item Graph Gizmos can now be selectively shown or hidden per graph (small \char`\"{}eye\char`\"{} icon to the right of the graph\textquotesingle{}s name)
\item Added Graph\+Update\+Utilities with many useful functions for updating graphs.
\item Erosion for grid graphs can now use tags instead of walkability
\item Fixed a bug where using One Way links could in some cases result in a Null\+Reference\+Exception being thrown.
\item Vector3 fields in the graph editors now look a bit better in Unity 3.\+5+. Editor\+G\+U\+I\+Layout.\+Vector3\+Field didn\textquotesingle{}t show the X\+YZ labels in a good way (no idea why)
\item Grid\+Graph.\+use\+Raycast\+Normal is now enabled only if the Max Slope is less than 90 degrees. Previously it was a manual setting.
\item The keyboard shortcut to scan all graphs does now also work even when the graphs are not deserialized yet (which happens a lot in the editor)
\item Added Node\+Link script, which can be attached to Game\+Objects to add manual links. This system will eventually replace the links system in the A$\ast$ editor.
\item Added keyboard shortcuts for adding and removing links. See Menubar -\/$>$ Edit -\/$>$ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} Note\+: Some features are restricted to Unity 3.\+5 and newer because of technical limitations in earlier versions (especially multi-\/object editing related features).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+1 beta (version number 3.\+0.\+9.\+9 in Unity due to technical limitations of the System.\+Versions class)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Multithreading is now enabled in the free version of the A$\ast$ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} Project!
\item Better support for graph updates called during e.\+g On\+Post\+Scan.
\item Path\+ID is now used as a short everywhere in the project
\item G,H and penalty is now used as unsigned integers everywhere in the project instead of signed integers.
\item There is now only one tag per node (if not the $<$see cref=\char`\"{}define\char`\"{}/$>$ Configure\+Tags\+As\+Multiple is set).
\item Fixed a bug which could make connections between graphs invalid when loading from file (would also log annoying error messages).
\item Erosion (Grid\+Graph) can now be used even when updating the graph during runtime.
\item Fixed a bug where the Grid\+Graph could return null from it\textquotesingle{}s Get\+Nearest\+Force calls which ended up later throwing a Null\+Reference\+Exception.
\item Funnel\+Modifier no longer warns if any graph in the path does not implement the I\+Funnel\+Graph interface (i.\+e have no support for the funnel algorithm) and instead falls back to add node positions to the path.
\item Added a new graph type \+: Layer\+Grid\+Graph which works like a Grid\+Graph, but has support for multiple layers of nodes (e.\+g multiple floors in a building).
\item Scan\+On\+Startup is now exposed in the editor.
\item Separated temporary path data and connectivity data.
\item Rewritten multithreading. You can now run any number of threads in parallel.
\item To avoid possible infinite loops, paths are no longer returned with just an error when requested at times they should not (e.\+g right when destroying the pathfinding object)
\item Cleaned up code in Astar\+Path.\+cs, members are now structured and many obsolete members have been removed.
\item Rewritten serialization. Now uses Json for settings along with a small part hardcoded binary data (for performance and memory). This is a lot more stable and will be more forwards and backwards compatible. Data is now saved as zip files(in memory, but can be saved to file) which means you can actually edit them by hand if you want!
\item Added dependency Json\+Fx (modified for smaller code size and better compatibility).
\item Added dependency Dot\+Net\+Zip (reduced version and a bit modified) for zip compression.
\item Graph types wanting to serialize members must add the Json\+Opt\+In attribute to the class and Json\+Member to any members to serialize (in the Json\+Fx.\+Json namespace)
\item Graph types wanting to serialize a bit more data (custom), will have to override some new functions from the Nav\+Graph class to do that instead of the old serialization functions.
\item Changed from using System.\+Guid to a custom written Guid implementation placed in \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_pathfinding_1_1_util_1_1_guid}{Pathfinding.\+Util.\+Guid}}. This was done to improve compabitility with i\+OS and other platforms. Previously it could crash when trying to create one because System.\+Guid was not included in the runtime.
\item Renamed callback Astar\+Path.\+On\+Safe\+Node\+Update to Astar\+Path.\+On\+Safe\+Callback (also added Astar\+Path.\+On\+Thread\+Safe\+Callback)
\item Multi\+Target\+Path would throw Null\+Reference\+Exception if no valid start node was found, fixed now.
\item Binary heaps are now automatically expanded if needed, no annoying warning messages.
\item Fixed a bug where grid graphs would not update the correct area (using Graph\+Update\+Object) if it was rotated.
\item Node position precision increased from 100 steps per world unit to 1000 steps per world unit (if 1 world unit = 1m, that is mm precision). This also means that all costs and penalties in graphs will need to be multiplied by 10 to match the new scale. It also means the max range of node positions is reduced a bit... but it is still quite large (about 2 150 000 world units in either direction, that should be enough).
\item If Unity 3.\+5 is used, the Editor\+G\+U\+I\+Utility.\+is\+Pro\+Skin field is used to toggle between light and dark skin.
\item Added Layered\+Grid\+Graph which works almost the same as grid graphs, but support multiple layers of nodes.
\item Note\+: Dropped Unity 3.\+3 support.

{\bfseries{Known Bugs\+:}} The C++ version of Recast does not work on Windows
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Documentation Update
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed from Fixed\+Update to Update in the Get Started Guide. Character\+Controller.\+Simple\+Move should not be called more than once per frame, so this might have lowered performance when using many agents, sorry about this typo.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+0.\+9
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The List Graph\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}raycast\char`\"{} variable is now serialized correctly, so it will be saved.
\item List graphs do not generate connections from nodes to themselves anymore (yielding slightly faster searches)
\item List graphs previously calculated cost values for connections which were very low (they should have been 100 times larger), this can have caused searches which were not very accurate on small scales since the values were rounded to the nearest integer.
\item Added Pathfinding.\+Path.\+recalc\+Start\+End\+Costs to specify if the start and end nodes connection costs should be recalculated when searching to reflect small differences between the node\textquotesingle{}s position and the actual used start point. It is on by default but if you change node connection costs you might want to switch it off to get more accurate paths.
\item Fixed a compile time warning in the free version from referecing obsolete variables in the project.
\item Added Astar\+Path.\+thread\+Timeout\+Frames which specifies how long the pathfinding thread will wait for new work to turn up before aborting (due to request). This variable is not exposed in the inspector yet.
\item Fixed typo, either there are eight (8) or four (4) max connections per node in a Grid\+Graph, never six (6).
\item Alternative\+Path will no longer cause errors when using multithreading!
\item Added Pathfinding.\+Constant\+Path, a path type which finds all nodes in a specific distance (cost) from a start node.
\item Added Pathfinding.\+Flood\+Path and Pathfinding.\+Flood\+Path\+Tracer as an extreamly fast way to generate paths to a single point in for example TD games.
\item Fixed a bug in Multi\+Target\+Path which could make it extreamly slow to process. It would not use much C\+PU power, but it could take half a second for it to complete due to excessive yielding
\item Fixed a bug in Flee\+Path, it now returns the correct path. It had previously sometimes returned the last node searched, but which was not necessarily the best end node (though it was often close)
\item Using $<$see cref=\char`\"{}defines\char`\"{}/$>$, the pathfinder can now be better profiled (see Optimizations tab -\/$>$ Profile Astar)
\item Added example scene Path Types (mainly useful for A$\ast$ Pro users, so I have only included it for them)
\item Added many more tooltips in the editor
\item Fixed a bug which would double the Y coordinate of nodes in grid graphs when loading from saved data (or caching startup)
\item Graph saving to file will now work better for users of the Free version, I had forgot to include a segment of code for Grid Graphs (sorry about that)
\item Some other bugfixes
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+0.\+8.\+2
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a critical bug which could render the A$\ast$ inspector unusable on Windows due to problems with backslashes and forward slashes in paths.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+0.\+8.\+1
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed critical crash bug. When building, a preprocessor-\/directive had messed up serialization so the game would probably crash from an Out\+Of\+Memory\+Exception.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+0.\+8
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Graph saving to file is now exposed for users of the Free version
\item Fixed a bug where penalties added using a Graph\+Update\+Object would be overriden if update\+Physics was turned on in the Graph\+Update\+Object
\item Fixed a bug where list graphs could ignore some children nodes, especially common if the hierarchy was deep
\item Fixed the case where empty messages would spam the log (instead of spamming somewhat meaningful messages) when path logging was set to Only Errors
\item Changed the N\+N\+Constraint used as default when calling Nav\+Graph.\+Get\+Nearest from N\+N\+Constraint.\+Default to N\+N\+Constraint.\+None, this is now the same as the default for \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a7d49736e7a25f4cf9fc24bdbec862359}{Astar\+Path.\+Get\+Nearest}}.
\item You can now set the size of the red cubes shown in place of unwalkable nodes (Settings-\/-\/$>$Show Unwalkable Nodes-\/-\/$>$Size)
\item Dynamic search of where the Editor\+Assets folder is, so now you can place it anywhere in the project.
\item Minor A$\ast$ inspector enhancements.
\item Fixed a very rare bug which could, when using multithreading cause the pathfinding thread not to start after it has been terminated due to a long delay
\item Modifiers can now be enabled or disabled in the editor
\item Added custom inspector for the Simple Smooth Modifier. Hopefully it will now be easier to use (or at least get the hang on which fields you should change).
\item Added A\+I\+Follow.\+can\+Search to disable or enable searching for paths due to popular request.
\item Added A\+I\+Follow.\+can\+Move to disable or enable moving due to popular request.
\item Changed behaviour of A\+I\+Follow.\+Stop, it will now set A\+I\+Follow.\+ccan\+Search and A\+I\+Follow.\+ccan\+Move to false thus making it completely stop and stop searching for paths.
\item Removed Path.\+custom\+Data since it is a much better solution to create a new path class which inherits from Path.
\item Seeker.\+Start\+Path is now implemented with overloads instead of optional parameters to simplify usage for Javascript users
\item Added Curved Nonuniform spline as a smoothing option for the Simple Smooth modifier.
\item Added Pathfinding.\+Will\+Block\+Path as function for checking if a Graph\+Update\+Object would block pathfinding between two nodes (useful in TD games).
\item Unity References (Game\+Object\textquotesingle{}s, Transforms and similar) are now serialized in another way, hopefully this will make it more stable as people have been having problems with the previous one, especially on the i\+Phone.
\item Added shortcuts to specific types of graphs, Astar\+Data.\+navmesh, Astar\+Data.\+grid\+Graph, Astar\+Data.\+list\+Graph
\item {\bfseries{Known Bugs\+:}} The C++ version of Recast does not work on Windows
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+0.\+7
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Grid Graphs can now be scaled to allow non-\/square nodes, good for isometric games.
\item Added more options for custom links. For example individual nodes or connections can be either enabled or disabled. And penalty can be added to individual nodes
\item Placed the Scan keyboard shortcut code in a different place, hopefully it will work more often now
\item Disabled G\+U\+I\+Layout in the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path}{Astar\+Path}} script for a possible small speed boost
\item Some debug variables (such as Astar\+Path.\+Paths\+Completed) are now only updated if the Profile\+Astar define is enabled
\item Dynamic\+Grid\+Obstacle will now update nodes correctly when the object is destroyed
\item Unwalkable nodes no longer shows when Show Graphs is not toggled
\item Removed Path.\+multithreaded since it was not used
\item Removed Path.\+pre\+Callback since it was obsolate
\item Added Pathfinding.\+X\+Path as a more customizable path
\item Added example of how to use Multi\+Target\+Paths to the documentation as it was seriously lacking info on that area
\item The viewing mesh scaling for recast graphs is now correct also for the C\# version
\item The Start\+End\+Modifier now changes the path length to 2 for correct applying if a path length of 1 was passed.
\item The progressbar is now removed even if an exception was thrown during scanning
\item Two new example scenes have been added, one for list graphs which includes sample links, and another one for recast graphs
\item Reverted back to manually setting the dark skin option, since it didn\textquotesingle{}t work in all cases, however if a dark skin is detected, the user will be asked if he/she wants to enable the dark skin
\item Added gizmos for the A\+I\+Follow script which shows the current waypoint and a circle around it illustrating the distance required for it to be considered \char`\"{}reached\char`\"{}.
\item The C\# version of Recast does now use Character Radius instead of Erosion Radius (world units instead of voxels)
\item Fixed an Index\+Out\+Of\+Range exception which could occur when saving a graph with no nodes to file
\item {\bfseries{Known Bugs\+:}} The C++ version of Recast does not work on Windows
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+0.\+6
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for a C++ version of Recast which means faster scanning times and more features (though almost no are available at the moment since I haven\textquotesingle{}t added support for them yet).
\item Removed the overload Astar\+Data.\+Add\+Graph (string type, Nav\+Graph graph) since it was obsolete. Astar\+Data.\+Add\+Graph (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_nav_graph}{Pathfinding.\+Nav\+Graph}}) should be used now.
\item Fixed a few bugs in the Funnel\+Modifier which could cause it to return invalid paths
\item A reference image can now be generated for the Use Texture option for Grid Graphs
\item Fixed an editor bug with graphs which had no editors
\item Graphs with no editors now show up in the Add New Graph list to show that they have been found, but they cannot be used
\item Deleted the graph\+Index parameter in the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_nav_graph_a39f2705caa347e4614d2b46fd0ac5f27}{Pathfinding.\+Nav\+Graph.\+Scan}} function. If you need to use it in your graph\textquotesingle{}s Scan function, get it using \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_astar_data_a7feed04d37b0456c3f5b9536b39586ba}{Pathfinding.\+Astar\+Data.\+Get\+Graph\+Index}}
\item Javascript support! At last you can use Js code with the A$\ast$ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} Project! Go to A$\ast$ Inspector-\/-\/$>$Settings-\/-\/$>$Editor-\/-\/$>$Enable Js Support to enable it
\item The Dark Skin is now automatically used if the rest of Unity uses the dark skin(hopefully)
\item Fixed a bug which could cause Unity to crash when using multithreading and creating a new \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path}{Astar\+Path}} object during runtime
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 3.\+0.\+5
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_point_graph}{List Graphs }} now support Update\+Graphs. This means that they for example can be used with the Dynamic\+Obstacle script.
\item List Graphs can now gather nodes based on Game\+Object tags instead of all nodes as childs of a specific Game\+Object.
\item List Graphs can now search recursively for childs to the \textquotesingle{}root\textquotesingle{} Game\+Object instead of just searching through the top-\/level children.
\item Added custom area colors which can be edited in the inspector (A$\ast$ inspector -\/-\/$>$ Settings -\/-\/$>$ Color Settings -\/-\/$>$ Custom Area Colors)
\item Fixed a Null\+Reference bug which could occur when loading a Unity Reference with the Astar\+Serializer.
\item Fixed some bugs with the Flee\+Path and Random\+Path which could cause the Start\+End\+Modifier to assign the wrong endpoint to the path.
\item Documentation is now more clear on what is A$\ast$ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} Project Pro only features.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_n_n_constraint}{Pathfinding.\+N\+N\+Constraint}} now has a variable to constrain which graphs to search (A$\ast$ Pro only).~\newline
 This is also available for \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_graph_update_object}{Pathfinding.\+Graph\+Update\+Object}} which now have a field for an N\+N\+Constraint where it can constrain which graphs to update.
