\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em AI for following paths. This AI is the default movement script which comes with the A$\ast$ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} Project. It is in no way required by the rest of the system, so feel free to write your own. But I hope this script will make it easier to set up movement for the characters in your game. This script is not written for high performance, so I do not recommend using it for large groups of units. ~\newline

This script will try to follow a target transform, in regular intervals, the path to that target will be recalculated. It will on Fixed\+Update try to move towards the next point in the path. However it will only move in the forward direction, but it will rotate around it\textquotesingle{}s Y-\/axis to make it reach the target. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item
