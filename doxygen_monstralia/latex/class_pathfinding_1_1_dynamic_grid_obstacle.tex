\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Attach this script to any obstacle with a collider to enable dynamic updates of the graphs around it. When the object has moved a certain distance (or actually when it\textquotesingle{}s bounding box has changed by a certain amount) defined by \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_dynamic_grid_obstacle_a5e662a596d1fa65c7d9d79c42ea76416}{update\+Error}} it will call \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a6d6ca9490291366e24cde5ef10d23c30}{Astar\+Path.\+Update\+Graphs}} and update the graph around it. 

Make sure that any children colliders do not extend beyond the bounds of the collider attached to the Game\+Object that the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_dynamic_grid_obstacle}{Dynamic\+Grid\+Obstacle}} component is attached to since this script only updates the graph around the bounds of the collider on the same Game\+Object.

This script works with both 2D colliders and normal 3D colliders.

Note\+: This script only works with \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_grid_graph}{Grid\+Graph}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_point_graph}{Point\+Graph}} and Layer\+Grid\+Graph

Revert graphs when disabled. When the Dynamic\+Obstacle is disabled or destroyed, a last graph update should be done to revert nodes to their original state

Called right after all graphs have been scanned. Flood\+Fill and other post processing has not been done. 

Warning\+: Since On\+Enable and Awake are called roughly in the same time, the only way to ensure that these scripts get this call when scanning in Awake is to set the Script Execution Order for \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path}{Astar\+Path}} to some time later than default time (see Edit -\/$>$ Project Settings -\/$>$ Script Execution Order). T\+O\+DO\+: Is this still relevant? A call to Find\+All\+Modifiers should have before this method is called so the above warning is probably not relevant anymore.
