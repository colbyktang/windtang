\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Builds a delaunay triangulation using the divide-\/and-\/conquer algorithm. 

The divide-\/and-\/conquer bounding box

I originally implemented the divide-\/and-\/conquer and incremental Delaunay triangulations using the edge-\/based data structure presented by Guibas and Stolfi. Switching to a triangle-\/based data structure doubled the speed. However, I had to think of a few extra tricks to maintain the elegance of the original algorithms.

The \char`\"{}bounding box\char`\"{} used by my variant of the divide-\/and-\/conquer algorithm uses one triangle for each edge of the convex hull of the triangulation. These bounding triangles all share a common apical vertex, which is represented by N\+U\+LL and which represents nothing. The bounding triangles are linked in a circular fan about this N\+U\+LL vertex, and the edges on the convex hull of the triangulation appear opposite the N\+U\+LL vertex. You might find it easiest to imagine that the N\+U\+LL vertex is a point in 3D space behind the center of the triangulation, and that the bounding triangles form a sort of cone.

This bounding box makes it easy to represent degenerate cases. For instance, the triangulation of two vertices is a single edge. This edge is represented by two bounding box triangles, one on each \char`\"{}side\char`\"{} of the edge. These triangles are also linked together in a fan about the N\+U\+LL vertex.

The bounding box also makes it easy to traverse the convex hull, as the divide-\/and-\/conquer algorithm needs to do.

\end{DoxyReturn}


Sorts the vertices, calls a recursive procedure to triangulate them, and removes the bounding box, setting boundary markers as appropriate.
