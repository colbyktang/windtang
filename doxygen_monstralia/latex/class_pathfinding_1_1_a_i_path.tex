AI for following paths. This AI is the default movement script which comes with the A$\ast$ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} Project. It is in no way required by the rest of the system, so feel free to write your own. But I hope this script will make it easier to set up movement for the characters in your game. This script works well for many types of units, but if you need the highest performance (for example if you are moving hundreds of characters) you may want to customize this script or write a custom movement script to be able to optimize it specifically for your game.

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
AI for following paths. This AI is the default movement script which comes with the A$\ast$ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_pathfinding}{Pathfinding}} Project. It is in no way required by the rest of the system, so feel free to write your own. But I hope this script will make it easier to set up movement for the characters in your game. This script works well for many types of units, but if you need the highest performance (for example if you are moving hundreds of characters) you may want to customize this script or write a custom movement script to be able to optimize it specifically for your game. 

This script will try to move to a given \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_adc4e4d26d791e66ecebfc00fbb03328f}{destination}}. At repath\+Rate regular, the path to the destination will be recalculated. If you want to make the AI to follow a particular object you can attach the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_destination_setter}{Pathfinding.\+A\+I\+Destination\+Setter}} component. Take a look at the getstarted (view in online documentation for working links) tutorial for more instructions on how to configure this script.

Here is a video of this script being used move an agent around (technically it uses the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_examples_1_1_mine_bot_a_i}{Pathfinding.\+Examples.\+Mine\+Bot\+AI}} script that inherits from this one but adds a bit of animation support for the example scenes)\+: \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see videos\mbox{]}\hypertarget{class_pathfinding_1_1_legacy_1_1_legacy_a_i_path_variables}{}\doxysubsection{Quick overview of the variables}\label{class_pathfinding_1_1_legacy_1_1_legacy_a_i_path_variables}
In the inspector in Unity, you will see a bunch of variables. You can view detailed information further down, but here\textquotesingle{}s a quick overview.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_afa4d04fa3ca0dab9efd337f4137aaee1}{repath\+Rate}} determines how often it will search for new paths, if you have fast moving targets, you might want to set it to a lower value. The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_adc4e4d26d791e66ecebfc00fbb03328f}{destination}} field is where the AI will try to move, it can be a point on the ground where the player has clicked in an R\+TS for example. Or it can be the player object in a zombie game. The max\+Speed is self-\/explanatory, as is \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_a7b098446f4a5661897899513e20b233e}{rotation\+Speed}}. however \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_a6e7ea1154c5523c0767aca0d8e1938b8}{slowdown\+Distance}} might require some explanation\+: It is the approximate distance from the target where the AI will start to slow down. Setting it to a large value will make the AI slow down very gradually. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_adabb6114c1087142079534f593bfae82}{pick\+Next\+Waypoint\+Dist}} determines the distance to the point the AI will move to (see image below).

Below is an image illustrating several variables that are exposed by this class (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_adabb6114c1087142079534f593bfae82}{pick\+Next\+Waypoint\+Dist}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_a6317497174b6c9551cfbbec0692f6326}{steering\+Target}}, desired\+Velocity) \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}

This script has many movement fallbacks. If it finds an R\+V\+O\+Controller attached to the same Game\+Object as this component, it will use that. If it finds a character controller it will also use that. If it finds a rigidbody it will use that. Lastly it will fall back to simply modifying Transform.\+position which is guaranteed to always work and is also the most performant option.\hypertarget{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_how-aipath-works}{}\doxysubsection{How it works}\label{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_how-aipath-works}
In this section I\textquotesingle{}m going to go over how this script is structured and how information flows. This is useful if you want to make changes to this script or if you just want to understand how it works a bit more deeply. However you do not need to read this section if you are just going to use the script as-\/is.

This script inherits from the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base}{A\+I\+Base}} class. The movement happens either in Unity\textquotesingle{}s standard \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_a942fc9185cd8c810e9421c0b5ea2b510}{Update}} or \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_ae97d5e5c84ee58146b9a6c5fdfaf206a}{Fixed\+Update}} method. They are both defined in the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base}{A\+I\+Base}} class. Which one is actually used depends on if a rigidbody is used for movement or not. Rigidbody movement has to be done inside the Fixed\+Update method while otherwise it is better to do it in Update.

From there a call is made to the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_a3db178e3286c1cdf6c43d146797df942}{Movement\+Update}} method (which in turn calls Movement\+Update\+Internal). This method contains the main bulk of the code and calculates how the AI {\itshape wants} to move. However it doesn\textquotesingle{}t do any movement itself. Instead it returns the position and rotation it wants the AI to move to have at the end of the frame. The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_a942fc9185cd8c810e9421c0b5ea2b510}{Update}} (or Fixed\+Update) method then passes these values to the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_aebdae01932608c6e0a429a1de2c98089}{Finalize\+Movement}} method which is responsible for actually moving the character. That method also handles things like making sure the AI doesn\textquotesingle{}t fall through the ground using raycasting.

The AI recalculates its path regularly. This happens in the Update method which checks \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_a98a6be29702d08fdd2f006b4662b45c2}{should\+Recalculate\+Path}} and if that returns true it will call \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_a26afcddbffa25240e2a0919b34c186a3}{Search\+Path}}. The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_base_a26afcddbffa25240e2a0919b34c186a3}{Search\+Path}} method will prepare a path request and send it to the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_seeker}{Pathfinding.\+Seeker}} component which should be attached to the same Game\+Object as this script. Since this script will when waking up register to the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_seeker_ae27c1c3ddc0f49a7a5992421757141ac}{Pathfinding.\+Seeker.\+path\+Callback}} delegate this script will be notified every time a new path is calculated by the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_a7713dd3f6c48e79e7198158ce1a434aa}{On\+Path\+Complete}} method being called. It may take one or sometimes multiple frames for the path to be calculated, but finally the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_a7713dd3f6c48e79e7198158ce1a434aa}{On\+Path\+Complete}} method will be called and the current path that the AI is following will be replaced.

Ensure that the character is always on the traversable surface of the navmesh. When this option is enabled a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_astar_path_a7d49736e7a25f4cf9fc24bdbec862359}{Astar\+Path.\+Get\+Nearest}} query will be done every frame to find the closest node that the agent can walk on and if the agent is not inside that node, then the agent will be moved to it. 

This is especially useful together with local avoidance in order to avoid agents pushing each other into walls. See\+: local-\/avoidance (view in online documentation for working links) for more info about this.

This option also integrates with local avoidance so that if the agent is say forced into a wall by other agents the local avoidance system will be informed about that wall and can take that into account.

Enabling this has some performance impact depending on the graph type (pretty fast for grid graphs, slightly slower for navmesh/recast graphs). If you are using a navmesh/recast graph you may want to switch to the Pathfinding.\+Rich\+AI movement script which is specifically written for navmesh/recast graphs and does this kind of clamping out of the box. In many cases it can also follow the path more smoothly around sharp bends in the path.

It is not recommended that you use this option together with the funnel modifier on grid graphs because the funnel modifier will make the path go very close to the border of the graph and this script has a tendency to try to cut corners a bit. This may cause it to try to go slightly outside the traversable surface near corners and that will look bad if this option is enabled.

Warning\+: This option makes no sense to use on point graphs because point graphs do not have a surface. Enabling this option when using a point graph will lead to the agent being snapped to the closest node every frame which is likely not what you want.

Below you can see an image where several agents using local avoidance were ordered to go to the same point in a corner. When not constraining the agents to the graph they are easily pushed inside obstacles. \mbox{[}Open online documentation to see images\mbox{]}\mbox{\Hypertarget{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_ae0a95b519a9e41da2b08af2983d1c778}\label{class_pathfinding_1_1_a_i_path_ae0a95b519a9e41da2b08af2983d1c778}}

How quickly the agent accelerates. Positive values represent an acceleration in world units per second squared. Negative values are interpreted as an inverse time of how long it should take for the agent to reach its max speed.

In the Unity inspector there are two modes\+: Default and Custom. In the Default mode this field is set to -\/2.\+5 which means that it takes about 0.\+4 seconds for the agent to reach its top speed.
